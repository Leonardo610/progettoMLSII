<sentences><sentence id="0"><text>The pizza was okay. Not the best I've had. I prefer Biaggio's on Flamingo / Fort Apache. The chef there can make a MUCH better NY style pizza. The pizzeria @ Cosmo was over priced for the quality and lack of personality in the food. Biaggio's is a much better pick if youre going for italian - family owned, home made recipes, people that actually CARE if you like their food. You dont get that at a pizzeria in a casino. I dont care what you say...</text></sentence><sentence id="1"><text>I love this place! My fiance And I go here atleast once a week. The portions are huge! Food is amazing. I love their carne asada. They have great lunch specials... Leticia is super nice and cares about what you think of her restaurant. You have to try their cheese enchiladas too the sauce is different And amazing!!!</text></sentence><sentence id="2"><text>Terrible. Dry corn bread. Rib tips were all fat and mushy and had no flavor. If you want bbq in this neighborhood go to john mulls roadkill grill. Trust me.</text></sentence><sentence id="3"><text>Back in 2005-2007 this place was my FAVORITE thai place EVER. I'd go here ALLLLL the time. I never had any complaints. Once they started to get more known and got busy, their service started to suck and their portion sizes got cut in half. I have a huge problem with paying MORE for way less food. The last time I went there I had the Pork Pad se Ew and it tasted good, but I finished my plate and was still hungry. I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a "Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke &amp; pad thai or pad se ew?" Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money. I havent been back in over a year because I refuse to pay $10-15 for dinner and still be hungry after. Sorry PinKaow, you are not what you used to be!!</text></sentence><sentence id="4"><text>Delicious healthy food. The steak is amazing. Fish and pork are awesome too. Service is above and beyond. Not a bad thing to say about this place. Worth every penny!</text></sentence><sentence id="5"><text>This place sucks. The customer service is horrible. They dont serve food unless you order a pizza from a neighboring restaurant. Who does that? They dont control their crowd. Many times I've gone I've seen fights. The bartenders suck - I've almost got in a fight with one because she was a complete bitch. Refused to serve me a drink because she was "busy" celebrating her friends birthday BEHIND THE BAR. This place is ridiculous. I will NEVER go there again.. EVER.</text></sentence><sentence id="6"><text>If you like Thai food, you have to try the original thai bbq. Their pad se ew is to DIE for. Their thai egg rolls are delicious. Basil beef will not let you down (its not on the menu anymore, you have to ask for it!) 

Yes, the building is not as fancy as some other places. Yes, i've batted a fly off my plate more than once. Yes, I do NOT go to the bathroom their because I dont even WANT to know what it looks like... 

BUT.. the thai food is the best in town. The service rocks. And you can get a $25 gift cert. on Restaurant.com for $2. Can you beat that? I think NOT.

This is the only place my husband and I go for anniversarys, date nights, birthdays.. anything!! I recommend it to everyone I know. If you KNOW good thai food, go here.</text></sentence><sentence id="7"><text>AMAZING!!!

 I was referred here by a friend and at first thought "Korean and Mexican?? WEIRD... i dont know"... but my husband and I were in the area and thought why not, lets try it... after my friend had nothing but great things to say about this place. We tried the chimichanga and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.... We actually did 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef (have you EVER been to a place that will make a burrito half and half? i havent!) The meat has fantastic flavor. I'm not a beef girl but i'd order a whole plate of their beef - its that good. The chimichanga was HUGE enough for both of us to share it (and my husband also had a beef taco which also was delicious) and we were FULL and it was $11 total with drinks. YOu cant beat that.

THe service was great. The server was so nice and attentive- you could tell she was the owner. 

The only thing I'd change is their chips they serve. They were burnt, too thick and kind of bland but their salsa is great. And lets face it, i'm fat so I we ate two baskets anyway so they cant be that bad. lol

All in all, food was delicious, A LOT of food for cheap, great prices, great service great flavor. Hell even my burps taste delicious. Bahaha!</text></sentence><sentence id="8"><text>Ribs = amazing
2 hour wait time= not so amazing, but understandable. 

This place would get 5 stars if they expanded their BBQ restaurant. Their ribs are AMAZING. You get SO much food for the price and it tastes sooo good. Plus, the two hour wait isnt always a bad thing because it gives you an excuse to drink and gamble while you wait!</text></sentence><sentence id="9"><text>Food is pretty good, not gonna lie. BUT you have to make sacrifices if you choose to eat there. It literally takes an hour to an hour and a half to deliver food. Seriously. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Doesnt matter if we order at 8am, 10am or 1pm. Never fails, they take F-O-R-E-V-E-R. If you dont get what you ordered or you are upset by them delivering your breakfast around LUNCH time, be ready to have the owner talk down to you and be a total bitch to you for i dont know, just wanting what you pay for?! 

Its over priced. But its decently tasteful food. Takes forever. Owners a witch. And i'm pretty sure that they continuing forget to pack my extra ranch just to piss me off. 

End Rant. 

PS- I've never gone in there to eat because i frankly, i'd rather tip the nice delivery driver then the ignorant imbeciles that work in the dining area. 

PPS- My hot chocolate today was cold. They should call it Cold Chocolate. Or start caring if their hot chocolate is hot. One of the two would be great!</text></sentence><sentence id="10"><text>I have been an Emerald Club member for a number of years.  I have always been very satisfied with their vehicles and customer service.  This recent visit to Pittsburgh was no exception.</text></sentence><sentence id="11"><text>The score should be negative. Its HORRIBLE. The have like 6-7 items in their buffet. No naans or salad. The items were either bland or stale. My friend had a potato curry which was completely stale without salt. The biriyani was okayish but bland. Would never recommend to anyone.</text></sentence><sentence id="12"><text>I went there twice and I am pretty happy with my haircut. The people are  really friendly. Would definitely go again.</text></sentence><sentence id="13"><text>Great for the price, only $25 for long hair! Was hesitant about dry cut but it turned out good!</text></sentence><sentence id="14"><text>Sansotei serves some top notch ramen. They take no reservations, so my company of five had to wait outside for about half an hour. I guess it's normal for Saturday night. Unlike my favorite ramen place in NYC you can only order what's on a menu. No deviations or improvisations whatsoever. Our waitress didn't speak much English, and even after writing everything down still managed to make a mistake or two. But, my spicy sesame ramen called Tan Tan was exceptional. I can tell you that. Just the right thickness of broth, and taste - omg.</text></sentence><sentence id="15"><text>Of the several places to get bagels in Oakland, these bagels are the best. Really fresh and tasty and they taste homemade.

However, I wasn't crazy about their bagel and egg sandwiches.</text></sentence><sentence id="16"><text>Cool little place, nice atmosphere and staff. Great coffee too, go check em out!</text></sentence><sentence id="17"><text>Delicious, friendly staff, cool atmosphere, all around great experience! They have a pretty great selection of crepes and omelettes, among other things. I enjoyed the Cherry Omelette (cherry tomatoes, swiss cheese, potato slices, and bacon) which was pretty big and cooked perfectly! Nice side salad and bread as well. Coffee was great and our server was warm and polite. Would recommend!</text></sentence><sentence id="18"><text>Great haircut, cool atmosphere, and really nice people! The price is fair and he is very thorough. Really listens to what you want. Also, I recommend calling ahead to see if it is busy. Worked for me!</text></sentence><sentence id="19"><text>Finally! After trying many Mexican restaurants all thru Phoenix &amp; Scottsdale we found an authentic Mexican restaurant that was AMAZING! Fresh tortilla chip &amp; salsa ready and waiting at the table when we sat down. Food was incredible! I ordered the combo with a beef tamale with red sauce &amp; chicken enchilada. Both were full of meat from beginning to end &amp; had so much flavor! Highly recommend this place</text></sentence><sentence id="20"><text>One of the best breakfast places I've been to! The menu had so many options, above &amp; beyond your typical breakfast choices. Portions were HUGE and everything was delicious &amp; so fresh! Will definitely be back &amp; highly recommend!</text></sentence><sentence id="21"><text>Food was alright, the service was HORRIBLE! Both of our orders came out incorrect after waiting extremely long because they don't write anything down when they take the orders. I asked for greens at the end she confirmed did you say grits? I said no greens please.. still ended up with grits. Boyfriends whole order came out wrong and when they brought him back the right order pretty sure they brought out my grits they took back 5 min before from my wrong order and gave them to him. Waitress came back and just set the plate down and walked off. No sorry about that, does it look right now, do you need anything else.. just straight nothing. Never came by our whole meal to check on us.</text></sentence><sentence id="22"><text>DELICIOUS! forgot to take a before picture but as you can see it was amazing. We got 2 kinds of ribs, brisket &amp; chicken and literally every single one fell straight off the bone! Sides were all good. Cornbread before &amp; sugar donuts after. Will definitely be back.</text></sentence><sentence id="23"><text>If I could leave zero stars I would. This rude B at the door with the fake lashes and colored lens was super rude. We had entered the club earlier and upon leaving the guy at the door told us we could come back later for the show. But when we came back, one man let us through up to the door, but the B there said there was no re-entry. She then proceeded to tell us that we could talk to "the guy by the exit". Okay. Well FYI, if you've never been to a venue, you don't know exactly where everything is. We walked away and looked around and weren't sure where she was referring to so we went back and asked where the exit was. She rudely responded, "I SAID. Go see the guy by the exit OVER THERE."  Felicia. 

Basically everyone was rude. Not coming back.</text></sentence><sentence id="24"><text>Removed several pine trees from our house in Henderson, NV.  Ground the stumps to below ground level.  Quote, execution and billing all very professional.  Loved ability to pay bill from email invoice.  Will use again.</text></sentence><sentence id="25"><text>I have to write a review on the Fractured Prune. First off I love doughnuts second I used to work in a bakery. So I know a little about the almighty doughnut. I was there this past Thursday night at Westgate where I was having a nice dinner at Opah Life. I wanted a little desert so I went to this doughnut shop it seemed clean enough so I made my selections and took them home. Mistake should have eaten one there I would have ask for my money back. I took a bite out of each on to confirm what I thought they were the worst doughnuts I have ever had. Horrible not sure if the oils was rancid or not hot enough either way eat at your own risk.</text></sentence><sentence id="26"><text>I wish i could tell you all about the food but there was problem. My friend and went there for dinner we were seated quickly unfortunately it was in middle of the empty dinning room so we asked to be moved to the side which we were. Upon sitting down we were told we could only have one of the very small table tops there were two together so the hostess told us the manager said we couldn't use two table tops in the empty restaurant. So we got up and left. With the manager chasing us blaming the hostess for the the ridiculous action. Needles to say we will never return.</text></sentence><sentence id="27"><text>Wonderful! One of my favorite places. BBQ is expertly cooked and service is always prompt. The price is right.</text></sentence><sentence id="28"><text>The price is about the same as Quizinos. The sandwich was great! They have a live musician so it is kind of loud. It was a good experience.</text></sentence><sentence id="29"><text>The food was ok. You get a lot of food for the price. There is bot a lot of seating.</text></sentence><sentence id="30"><text>The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was fabulous. Our whole experience was awesome!</text></sentence><sentence id="31"><text>The staff were very helpful. We painted pottery which took about 2 hours. It was a lot of fun and we received our pottery with in 3 days.</text></sentence><sentence id="32"><text>Limited vegetarian options. Ordered Greek salad but it was sub-par and priced at a ridiculous (almost) thirteen dollars. Will be skipping this joint when traveling through this airport the next time.</text></sentence><sentence id="33"><text>After gown shopping in Los Angeles and Orange County for 3 months and not having the "this is the one moment" I made an appointment at Destiny's Bride.  My mom, my sisters and I were having a girls weekend in Scottsdale and wanted to gown shop for fun.  Residing in southern CA, we weren't planning on purchasing a dress out of state.  The boutique absolutely blew us away and the service was even better! Lisa, the owner, was amazing and it was by far the best customer service and experience out of all the high end shops I visited in CA. 
Lisa is extremely knowledgeable and was able to quickly pick out gowns for my body shape and taste.  She was honest with her opinion and took her time with me.  Photos of me in the gowns were allowed which I loved because this was not an option in Los Angeles.  
I found "the one" with Lisa and because we paid that day in full, she offered us a 10% discount!

The shop, selection and customer service were all A+ and I can't wait to return the shop for my fitting and to see Lisa!</text></sentence><sentence id="34"><text>I shop here mostly because i live in Brampton. Great customer service, well stocked and clean. 
But, beware of parking routes and stupid drivers. Gets hectic at busy times (weekends) so avoid. 'New' Canadian customers are rather rude and ignorant..so i go to Miss. or Vaughan locations when i can. You will notice the difference.</text></sentence><sentence id="35"><text>I trust my vehicles here. Comparable prices. Mike can always give me good advice. Work always done on time...clean. Never had to send back with any problems. My cars run great.</text></sentence><sentence id="36"><text>I really like this store. Very clean, well stocked and organized- every dept! Good signage to find products. They have good deals on sale weeks. Bought a couple of appliances here at same or cheaper price than other stores. Good paint-valspar. Helpful staff. Keep up the good work.
 This place makes Home depot look like a 3rd world country.</text></sentence><sentence id="37"><text>Best veal sandwich ever ( i like rapini/ garlic top)...pasta, lasagna, chicken...all good. Good service, nice clean place, parking, good food= 5</text></sentence><sentence id="38"><text>Non-existened service!  The waiter did not even great us and did not listen to me about ordering, so my male companion had to repeat it to him! Then many people different people tossed our food on the table while passing by without any word or an eye contact! Naan bread arrived much later from the soup! Its a shame that such a dreadful worse than a fast food corner restaurant occupies area in the heart of the Toronto's entertainment district! RUN AWAY,  DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY THERE!!</text></sentence><sentence id="39"><text>I was in Phoenix on business last week. My PHX based co-workers are frequent visitors and knowing I like BBQ, they took me to here. One word describes the food - amazing. I've had BBQ from a lot of places all over the country and the food here ranked at the top of the list for me. I had the two meat plate - brisket and pulled pork. Both were awesome. If you are in PHX and like BBQ, you have to come here. The line may be long, but it's truly worth the wait.</text></sentence><sentence id="40"><text>This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. Horrible service! The service manager was rude and unprofessional. He shouldn't even have a job after the way he spoke to customers. Marcus Lamonis needs to step in and end this location. Repairs that were suppose to be done never were completed.</text></sentence><sentence id="41"><text>The butter burger was cooked perfectly and juicy! The ice cream here is the best I've had! This location is very clean and staff was friendly!</text></sentence><sentence id="42"><text>Best location ever! I love love love the manager Jess. She's super great and always helpful. She always helps me find what I'm looking for and has the best suggestions for gifts. I will drive the half hour out of the way to go to this location!</text></sentence><sentence id="43"><text>Fab.U.Lous. Best scrambles eggs. Fluffy and tasty. Servings so large teenage athletes had leftovers. Been to Scrambled, US Egg, and we all vote Butterfields. The orange juice is absolutely delicious. Everyone was so nice despite the packed place, and they were fast too. Try it, they won't disappointed.</text></sentence><sentence id="44"><text>Easy access to the store with ample parking. If you want to be offered services you don't need, and given incorrect promo info, with no assistance on purchas products, this is THE place.

Came here with my son to pick up an online order and to have him look at phones. I got my phone and that was that, no offer to help set it up or tell me about cool features, I had to ask. I could sense the reluctance but my phone was set up, then strong push for Direct TV and a home alarm.

No acknowledgement of my son who was looking at phones, whom I asked (in front of the agent) if he found something (he did). Still no acknowledgement, so we left. Will probably get it online or find a store more willing to help. 

I miss the store inside PV mall. They were a 6 out of 5. Sad they closed.</text></sentence><sentence id="45"><text>Been here 3x and no beef #45, will stop coming; what's the point if it's always out. Take it off the menu since it's never available. Portions getting smaller, prices going up. And the table that came after us got to order first.</text></sentence><sentence id="46"><text>In case my email didn't work, still giving a 1.  I tried calling but customer service hours from 9-6 M--F.  I'm not the kind of person who spends my work hours on personal phone calls.  Email/msg me the info you need and I can send it over.  I still have a copy of my receipt and should not be jumping through a multitude of hoops for something like this (non error) on my part.</text></sentence><sentence id="47"><text>Nice place, games for younger kids, bar like feel for adults, missing the mark for teens; we tried hot dogs, burgers, sample platter, a little on the salty side, but otherwise OK.

Come early to avoid crowds/lines.</text></sentence><sentence id="48"><text>Despite the long drive thru line, they were really great. Happy to be there and helpful. Super efficient too.  Keep up the positive attitude!  I can see why people come over and wait patiently.</text></sentence><sentence id="49"><text>Drive thru: I guess it's opposite day at the drive thru.  Apparently a 'no, thank you' to 'do you want some ketchup' means 17 (I counted) ackets of ketchup for 1 order of fries. Less a star because I'm not a fan of people being wasteful. I know it's just a little thing, but it irks me.</text></sentence><sentence id="50"><text>Friendliest staff, no matter how swamped they are. Always smiling and gracious. Garlic parm and lemon pepper wings. Mmmmmmmm.

Love the simplicity of the place and the trinkets all over the walls, always discover something new.</text></sentence><sentence id="51"><text>Prefer the Harkins Theatres over AMC. Camelview for loungers, Tempe Marketplace to people and movie watch, Scottsdale for larger screens, and Shea when I'm feeling nostalgic.

It's very clean, someone is always cleaning or just finished cleaning the rest rooms. No popcorn droppings in the lobby, on the counters or condiment station. Always friendly, smiling faces ready to clean the auditorium after the movie.

The auditoriums don't have stadium seating but there's  and incline and easy to see the screen, chairs are comfortable but not as large as the newer chairs. There's a LOT of leg room. This is where we go when we want to watch a movie and 'travel' back in time to visit a movie theater very similar to the one we went to growing up.</text></sentence><sentence id="52"><text>Overall rating: 2.5 for a 4:30 weekday visit (no one at the bar and 4 tables, including us - mostly parties of 2, like us).

I've decided to count, from entering an establishment to the time our party is spotted to the time we are acknowledged or helped (no, I don't  speed count). This visit, it was 5 before we were spotted and 82 before a hostess came to seat us.

Place was clean, server prompt, nice. Salmon was dry, overcooked. Walnut and tempura shrimp were good but warm/cool, not hot. Liked the tofu and veggies. Fried prawns were tasty. Crab legs? Crab legs, nothing spectacular. The fried rice? Hardened, couldn't pay me to eat it. All the meat dishes, with the exception of almost well done prime rib (not happy that there was no one at the carving station to cut or anyone to call and ask) had an after taste of cough medicine - so did the tapioca, but cake was ok.

Also almost got run over by the hostess while on my way to get food, she was rushing toward the empty side of the restaurant. My response? Smile, and an 'oh, sorry excuse me.' Hers a raised eyebrow that became a frown and a parting huff. Wanna pay over $20 for that plus tax and tip? Go for it lol, I'll pass.</text></sentence><sentence id="53"><text>4 because there's this one cashier who, each time rang our purchases up (different weeks) always looked like a mix of anger and unhappiness for customers im general.

Store is clean, but I gotta say...having clothes for sale...somehow... I no longer wanna call it 'fancy frys' it now seems more like...'wannabe walmart.' 

Almost down to a 3 thanks to that, BUT the pharmacy staff....AweSOME! Super courteous and helpful, really great empathy toward each customer. Not an easy task but they are shining stars in my book.</text></sentence><sentence id="54"><text>2.5 stars. We've come here several times over the past few years and management is always different. This review is for   current management, supposedly 'original' management. 

I like that we no longer have to order and pay at the counter. We usually order calamari or calamari salad, katsu don.  This time the calamari was crispy but bland, the dipping sauce - no, thank you: tasted like mix of wasabi, tartar, and soap. Soy sauce saved the calamari.

Katsu don was super delicious and fresh. I was starving, finished mine and then went into a food coma. 

Staff was pleasant but the lower score is because: the place wasn't super busy (3 other tables, small parties 2-3 per table), and yet when we got there, our table was dirty - wiped away grease streak, 2 pcs of food laying on the table.

This place is closer to me than Tokyo Express...so I guess we'll come back.</text></sentence><sentence id="55"><text>Meh. 6 skinny mozzarella sticks for $7. It's an appetizer for and 1 adult and 1 toddler. Wish we just went to Costco to get a whole bag, but my teens were h-anger-y ;) 

Wednesday wings, glad they still have it. Stick with the original. I wouldn't recommend their wing sauce; their garlic parm is nothing compared to Long Wongs or Buffalo Wild Wings.

Fries were bland. The staff...they seemed "nice" but...off... 2-3x our server and this dude walked by said "how's everything going/tasting" and they kept walking without stopping or even really lookong at our table because each time that happened, one person in our party had an empty drink. They were just going through the smiles and verbal motions without actually...serving.

Would I go back to Hooters? Yes. This one? Neeeevvvaaahhhhhhh, go DOWNTOWN, not here.</text></sentence><sentence id="56"><text>Happy to be seated promptly on a Friday evening.  5 stars to Deb our waitress who was so pleasant, never let our drinks get low, and so quick to answer our questions.

My princess enjoyed her mac n cheese, the fettuccine was creamy, trio was huge, calamari = tasty. Spaghetti, meatballs and pomodoro were divine.

So why not a perfect rating? While we lucked out with Deb, I'm just not sure how others fared with the people helping them. Usually when we walk into or out of a restaurant, staff smile and say hi, say, "welcome to..." or acknowledge patrons in some way shape or form. Yesterday, all 4 of us were greeted with blank stares (again, except Deb).</text></sentence><sentence id="57"><text>Deeeeeeeeeeellllliiiissssshhhhhh!  More than a pleasant surprise, it's a super tasty delight. I expected yummy food and well, this was.....*sigh*.... ahhhhhhhhhhhh.

Regular fries were seasoned so well, burgers juicy, each item we tried had it's own flavor but blended really well together. Fresno chicken tacos....zing creeps up on you, paired with the sweetness of the carnival corn....more aaaahhhhhhs.

And the french toast fries.....OMG so good! Stop reading this and go there already (bring your friends and order different things so you can try it all).</text></sentence><sentence id="58"><text>Been coming here for years, always delicious food, served super fast, no matter how busy.

Service is excellent! Looking for real asian food? Head out to what my family calls, "Super D."

Pan fried noodles, salt and pepper pork chop are our faves.</text></sentence><sentence id="59"><text>More reasonably priced items here. Decent quality products. Good sales. Coupons are a bit confusing. Quite a few of them, but be sure to read the fine print otherwise you may be disappointed when you get to the store. My issue is that I called with the coupon on hand with a question thrying to clarify the exclusions but even the staff could not explain it to me. I do expect more from those who work there.</text></sentence><sentence id="60"><text>Regular starbucks, nothing special. No one exceptionally friendly or anything. Staff seemed more in a hurry to get back to chatting with one another, not really building rapport with customer. I guess I get it though, almost closing time. Quiet in here this evening.</text></sentence><sentence id="61"><text>Came here before the reno to watch foreign movies, and was oleasantly surprised then.

After the reno, wow! Seatsa are sooooooo comfortable. (I think maybe a bit too comfy because not ling into the previews, I heard snoring lol).

4 becasue it's far, but also concerned about coming here after dark and wondering if my car will be ok.</text></sentence><sentence id="62"><text>Never been inside. Always a drive through experience. The place could use retouching of paint, etc. By place I mean what little I can see from the drive thru window ;)

Food? 4.  Super tasty. Picky eater son loves their chicken tacos.  Try the patron burrito. I have half for breakfast and half for linner (lunch/dinner). It's THAT big.</text></sentence><sentence id="63"><text>If only it wasn't in a casino, I'd give it a 5 and come back more often. Thankfully, no smell of smoke inside. 

We were seated promptly at a booth and had a good time. Came here expecting over priced, bland food. Apparently I was in for a surprise.

Our server was prompt and nice. Hubby gave him 8 out of 10 rating (we ran too low on drinks once). The foooooood.....best calamari ever! Crispy, soft, and TASTY without the deep fried oily feeling. Don't usually like tartar sauce but loved this one.

Linguini was delicious-nice, subtle zing and scrumptious prawn.  Steak was succulent and delectable. We didn't have room for dessert because the portions were huge.

Reasonably priced for great food and large portions.</text></sentence><sentence id="64"><text>Everyone's always happy and incredibly helpful here. Mandarin chicken, chocolate croissants are our faves.

Kids love the little push carts - so cute! Sparkling lemonade is great with fresh strawberries.

Come check out all they have to offer...their flowers are beautiful too!</text></sentence><sentence id="65"><text>Have not actually been inside so this will be a review of multiple drive thru experiences, not a 5 because I haven't been inside but I'll do that next time and update my review.

We usually go for chicken tacos, quesadillas (chicken and cheese), patron, AZ, or carne asada burritos. Food is always hot, order always correct.  Food tastes good, not overly salty and definitely bland. It isn't a gourmet meal, but it hits the spot. Prices have gone up a bit but at least they didn't shrink the portions. 

This place stands out for me because no matter how big or 'customized' our order is (e.g. no pico or easy in lettuce, etc.), they've ALWAYS been super patient when taking the order and then super nice when we pick up our food.</text></sentence><sentence id="66"><text>My last review was a novel, this will be short. Ordered online for pick up, food was handed to me at EXACTLY that time, not a minute later. Aaarrrmmmyyygaaawwwd amazing!

Why the 3? One order was wrong :( BUT it was pretty good anyway so I'll leave it be. We're all human after all.</text></sentence><sentence id="67"><text>Busy holiday weekend, but all the staff from the ticket counter, concessions, and rest room attendants we really nice. Smiling without a hint of annoyance due to working on a holiday weekend with heavy traffic. 

It would have been a 3 due to smelly restroom but before I left, they were already on it. Service counts a lot.

Seats were comfortable with good leg room.</text></sentence><sentence id="68"><text>Went on the south side.  It was more flat, but at 100 degrees, I didn't really want to do climbing. Trail was clean and scenery was beautiful. Made me stop and just be. Very relaxing.

Definitely bring a lot of water, stay on the trail and please please take your trash with you.</text></sentence><sentence id="69"><text>Comfortable seats, happy they are not separated in clusters/groups like other theaters with recliners (works well with an odd numbered group).

Love the different seating options available while waiting for the movie.

$14 after 6pm movies is a bit steep, suggest at least a senior or student discount.</text></sentence><sentence id="70"><text>Best place for dim sum in the valley.  Prefer this one to the one at Mekong Plaza in Mesa.  Pork siomai is the family favorite. Calamari is the bomb, when the cook isn't in (he gets in about 10-11am on weekends), we get the Salt and Pepper squid from the a la carte menu. Shrimp egg rolls, mmmmmmm.</text></sentence><sentence id="71"><text>Laser maze is a blast for the kids, check Groupon for deals so you don't break the bank.

Love the sitting area outside, great for waiting parents when the weather is cool and breezy.

Bummer that you can't even bring water for a birthday party, it's $0.99 per additional 8oz bottle, but it beats the $1.25 pouch of Carpi Sun.  My kids love ice cream but we couldn't bring an ice cream cake either.  Loosen up, allow us to bring water (this is AZ) and our own cakes for the parties.</text></sentence><sentence id="72"><text>Food taste: 2

Liked that the screen is easier to read. Nice printed menus too. Purchased a Groupon  (4 burgers 4 sides) gave our orders (one burger and side to go) and was charged $26 and change. I'll take credit for signing and paying albeit confused, my mistake. Apparently lady assumed I only purchased a Groupon for (2 burgers and 2 sides). I pointed that out, she (lady 1) needed help and the lady (lady 2) who helped only asked the cash registrar for an explanation, not me. No sorry no nothing. Immediate refund of $21 no questions asked. I asked why it was only $21 not $26 and change, a brief and now obviously fake glance at the screen and I was told registrar was right not me. Lady 2 walks to the back and cancels 2 burgers and 2 sides. I patiently wait cause I understood the kitchen was busy and there was a line. I explained we needed 4 burgers and 4 fries again, no apologies for their own confusion and mistakes. Lady 2 just says the whole order needs to be cancelled and redone, again no apologies, didn't even offer to help further, just stayed in the kitchen. Lady 1 put in an order for the other 2 burgers and 2 fries (one to go) offered me 2 free drinks which I declined.

Guess what came to our table. Yep, 2 burgers and 2 fries (you know, the one pair that was to go). Explained to the server that we ordered 4, again no apologies, checks with the lady 1 at the register and shortly brings our order to us. Fries tasted like fries anywhere else, crispy, plain. Nothing special like before. Burgers were bland, both my husband and son said burgers were 'ok, not really tasty like last time.'

As we're eating, I notice lady 2 walking and chatting to other patrons. She stop by our table to make amends? Why of course not. She looked at us though, and walked away.

Last week I told my sisters to eat here. Just sent a message on group chat telling them not to waste their time. Few weeks ago told my coworkers to stop by here when they're in the neighborhood, I'll tell them about this visit on Monday.

My advice to management: Tell staff to read, slow down, listen and understand how important customer service is.

Advice to Yelpers: Smash Burger or In N Out. Taste hasn't changed, service much better. If in Vegas, Wahlburgers.</text></sentence><sentence id="73"><text>Great prices when there's a $10 off coupon. Lots of fun screen printed shirts for teens/tweens. (hint: Star Wars) 

Do the math before buying one at regular price and getting the next for a penny. Just sayin' use the arithmetic from elementary school.

They do have a better selection online. Love that when a size was not in stock at tje store, they ordered it for me online for store pick up and applied the store coupon and I didn't even have to ask.

Are all the staff that nice? No, BUT they are waaaay more helpful than that other dept store that rhymes with 'acy's.'</text></sentence><sentence id="74"><text>This was a real fun time. Lots of laughs and entertainment. Love that the cast interactions with all guests in a semi intimate setting.

Food was pretty decent as well. Like the salad dressing and love the sauce on the chicken. Bring cash for the bar and especially for the tip. Cast/staff work hard and deserve it :)

Burger was ok, veggies were fresh, loved the sauce and fries. I drive by here a lot, would stop for the fries. Also, wish I had known the corn is seasonal.  

Why the 3? Service. It was our first time and it was obvious, felt more like the lady ready to take our order just wanted to get it over with and us out of the way.

Like I said no line when we got there, not inside and 1 car at the drive thru.

Pit stop at Starbucks for frappucinos (for some of our friends who helped) and then at Dunkin for coolatas (for the other half).

Excuse my husband for being tired, human and saying the wrong drink name, 'frappe' instead of coolata being that he was exhausted and needed a pick me up. Apparently that is a personal offense to the Dunkin team. Instead of saying they serve 'coolatas' they server and his shift leader told my husband to go to Starbucks. I hope the franchise owner reads this so they know customers are being told to go across the street.  And btw, 'shift leader,' 'frappes' are at McDonalds.

Jerry our server was amazing! He was the only one in our section so I can't say service was speedy, but he was always smiling and gracious with each party even though I could see 1 party getting anxious.  The fact that he kept his composure, professionalism, and remained gracious - I commend that kind of service. Kudos, Jerry!

Watch yourself though, food is so light you may end up eating more than you should especially if you are trying to watch your waistline:)

He felt each coffee cake piece (to put in the bag) and didn't sell me one that felt soggy to the touch.  Asked for pork buns and he went to get the ones in the back that were fresh and cooling down.  Heated up the one piece I was going to eat in the car. (pork bun was so tasty!) All that without me having to ask. 

My fave are the mini sponge cakes with whipped topping and fruit on top, it's a little piece of heaven.  Having a party? Perfect dessert bite your guests will adore!</text></sentence><sentence id="79"><text>Horrible. The smart ones have closed their account. Tellers don't know how to read a day drop envelope that clearly reads MORTGAGE PAYMENT in front and back with the full loan number on it.

Manager doesn't take accountability for the lack of attention to detail of his staff or their errors.  Tried to blame me because they didnt believe I put anything on the envelope. Account numbers and account holder names sitting all over Christopher the teller's desk. People wonder why your accounts are compromised? Manager saw it and did nothing.

Excited because of the recliner seats. Overwhelmed when we stepped inside. The Marketplace was...well, we thought it was like a hospital cafeteria with a lot less staff and a giant mess. Popcorn all over the floors and counters, condiments spilled, condiment droppings on the counter. Saw 2 girls with brooms - not cleaning but chatting it up with the cashier.

Gotta line up 3 times, one to order, another to pay, and another to pick up your order. Pure confusion for a 1st timer. So you go back, front, and back. Liked the soda machine cause you pick and mix. The 'bar?' It looks like  and afterthought with I think 5 stools.

The bathroom. GROSS. 4 stalls not completely flushed and 1 with wet droppings on the floor. 2 sinks without soap and the used papertowels were overflowing. The automatic machine was rolling the new ones into the used ones. Did I mention there was red/brown debris on the stainless steel? 

Ok recliners but I doubt anyone actually measured the distance from the screen to the seats because we were on 2nd to last row and it still felt too close.

We searched Yelp and found him with all good reviews which made us decide to go to him for these very important pictures. The results are very disappointing! 

Jon seems to be a friendly person, except that in the beginning he tried to deny a Yelp deal that we purchased, as he claimed the deal is for family photos only, which was NOT said in the deal description when we purchased. Anyhow he accepted the deal we bought eventually. However, it turned out to be a terrible experience.  

First of all, his studio is in his house, or maybe more specifically, in his garage. Certainly it is not fun to take a one-hour-photo-shoot at such a place when the temperature is over 100 outside and there is limited air-conditioning in the garage. He had to use a fan trying to make it cooler. But most importantly, his technique is not very impressive at all.  My green dress turned out to be blue in my photos! The skin tone of my face in the pictures turned out to be uneven, despite the fact I was put on make-up by professional beauty artist. Also, his so-called touch-ups of the pictures are awful, that he didn't even try to take the shines on my face away! --- As a matter of fact, I don't think those pictures we purchased have been touched up at all!  

I am not sure if he is good at taking family pictures as other claimed in the reviews, but if you go for professional head-shots, I won't recommend him at all. It will be a total waste of your money and time!</text></sentence><sentence id="92"><text>Better service and much better prices than the dealership.

Completely inappropriate.  She also wouldn't stop complaining about how she's made minimum wage there for like 10 years, which says something about their judgement to employ someone like that for 10 years without firing them.  She also made me feel really guilty for dropping a few hundred dollars at the blackjack table instead of tipping her that money.  I wish I had someone to report her to, but they don't really seem to care.

A lot of my friends have mentioned this restaurant and stated how much they enjoyed the food so my boyfriend and I decided to stop by last weekend. First off, they have an amazing staff. Very nice and accommodating. The hostess was great and our server was on top of everything. We really appreciated him informing us that he was going on break and to let the other server know if we needed anything, to just ask. However, we never saw anyone for the last 20 minutes that we were there. They were very busy so we decided not to stay any longer and just walked up to someone at the bar and asked for assistance.

The food..... what can I say... the chicken satay was amazing and I loved the peanut sauce. I ordered the panang curry and my bf ordered the yellow curry (I think).... we love the flavor, but I was disappointed at the amount of chicken they put (which was barely any at all) in the generous bowl of curry they served it with. It was mainly vegetables and I had to fish for the tiny pieces of chicken hoping there was more at the bottom. I hate to do this, but I have to stress how VERY little meat there was in there :(  A few minutes later our pad Thai arrived. The noodles were completely white and the entire dish basically tasted like noodles with lime juice &amp; veggies. Where's the rest of the sauce?!?! The only reason I gave three stars is because I liked the staff and the atmosphere. I don't think I'll be coming back unless one of my friends who love this place really wants to go.</text></sentence><sentence id="97"><text>Had the ruby salad, carpaccio, salmon, and ravioli...... everything was literally amazing.

(see picture posted) This place hasn't changed my filter the both times I've come to them after telling them I need an oil and filter change. Both times I was also told it will take about 40min.... but only took 10.... did they even check anything else?

I always end up either ordering more or stopping by somewhere later because I'm still hungry. I think they should either lower the price or add more food. Just my opinion.</text></sentence><sentence id="102"><text>2 of my girlfriends recommended this place so all 3 of us went....

So you're telling me your main dining area (which was actually also pretty full ) should SUFFER just because the bar was full?????

Reason being, this isn't their first restaurant opening. Globe has two other locations, so it's owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant. But rather than focus on the facts that it smelled like a construction site, the floors and walls needed some minor finishing work, the staff were wandering about looking slightly confused and a little scared, and the place generally seemed like it probably wasn't ready to open just yet, I'm going to put all that aside and focus on the rest of Globe.

Globe's focus is on local stuff; that means they try to only serve products that are made close-to-home. Trouble is, I'm not exactly sure how far that close-to-home boundary extends to. I was told that it includes Ontario as a whole, but it could also go much further East or West; their Albacore tuna, for example, comes from BC and their mussels come from PEI. Other items don't explicitly explain where they come from, like the Cornish hen. That's the difficulty with going local though; right-off-the-bat you need to firmly establish your local boundaries. BC and PEI, after all, aren't right around the corner. Why not Maine lobster? Maine is a lot closer and seems a lot more local to me than anywhere in BC.

I suppose my beef here is that if you want to focus on locally produced stuff, then why not do it right down to the last detail? Why have a couple of wines from Italy and the US when you could easily make a wine menu completely from Niagara Peninsula wines or even from West Coast British Columbia (since we haven't yet established where that local line is drawn). I suppose the entire local concept is pretty hot right now, considering the whole farm-to-table trend, but those places are a bit more sincere by growing and sourcing everything onsite. To me, that's what true local eating is all about: setting firm boundaries.

The main thing that caught me right away-even more so than the local-ness of stuff-was the truly reasonable prices. At my initial walk-in to the beautiful dining room, I expected to pay a bit more, but that wasn't the case at all. Starters are around 11 bucks, entrees are around 22; at prices like that, it's even kind of refreshing, considering how elegant both the dining room and bar spaces are. And the food is good too. The local carnivore flatbread, for example, had a perfectly cooked flatbread base with some delicious, good-quality meats. The baked Spring vegetable tart seemed a little strange served on raw spinach, but the contrast worked nicely together.

The dining room space is beautiful. 20 foot ceilings, elegant lighting, solid wooden tables. In terms of sheer ambience and sophistication, there's nothing in Bloor West Village that can even come close to competing with Globe.

Despite the wandering servers, we were lucky enough to have the only one that seemed focused. Even though the meddling manager kept needlessly hovering over us mere seconds each time before our server got there, we had fantastic service that pretty much made the entire experience better. If we had another server, I probably would have thought a lot less.

Truth be told, Globe's focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion. However despite that, it was a pretty good overall experience, opening jitters and stage fright aside. I think that once they work all the kinks out, there'll be nothing in Bloor West Village-an area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin with-that can even come close to competing with Globe.</text></sentence><sentence id="110"><text>I have been itching to get to Origin for months now after a friend of mine had gone and raved about the food. I dug the concept: tapas with a twist. This is definitely not your traditional, Spanish tapas. At Origin, you'll sample small plates with Asian, Italian and Latin influences. I didn't find the menu overwhelming, but our server was more than happy to help steer the meal so that similar and complimentary flavours were eaten together.

It was tough to narrow it down, as we would have been happy with just about anything on the menu. We started with the tostones: smashed, flattened and deep-fried plantains with guacamole on the side. The plantains were very well seasoned, with generous use of kosher salt and a light dusting of curry powder.

Next up were the deviled eggs with smoked bacon and gremolata and the smoked cod croquettes with saffron aioli. Both were a big hit at the table, disappearing in a flash. I preferred the croquettes of the two, but I didn't exactly NOT eat my share of the deviled eggs either.

Those scrumptious bites devoured, we ordered another bottle of wine (three cheers for Monday night dinners with lots of wine!) and anticipated the arrival of more delectable plates. While we waited, we marveled at the strangeness of the cutlery provided. The only way to balance your knife was blade up. That seemed...dangerous. Especially after the third glass of cabernet sauvignon.

Our next dish appeared and we dove right back in (carefully, so as not to cut ourselves on our upturned knives). A gorgeously-presented order from the Mozzarella Bar: bufala mozzarella with pear, rosemary oil, pine nuts that was drizzled with honey and placed on a crunchy, toasted slice of calabrese bread.

Next up was the Bangkok beef salad with peanuts, mint, mango, fried shallots and a sweet and sour dressing. There was a moment of hesitation while we all tried to dance around the fact that splitting this thing among the three of us might get violent. In the end however, we shared well (our kindergarten teachers would be so proud!). This wasn't an exceptionally complicated dish, but it was done to perfection: the beef was tender and pink; the mangoes were ripe and slippery; the shallots and peanuts added the crunch the dish needed; and the cilantro added the wonderful, bright note at the end. It should be noted that my friend said it was the third time she'd had this particular dish, and it was exactly the same every time. THAT is a sign of a great restaurant.

Our final round of food was to arrive, and we were practically giddy with excitement. We had decided on the Chinois duck with pickled cucumber, hoisin and sriracha sauce on a chive pancake, the curried shrimp with naan and the miso-glazed black cod with soba noodles and a ginger vinaigrette. We knew each dish would be good, but didn't know HOW good. We had spent the first half of the meal happily eating away and we were by no means disappointed with our choices. But these last three dishes absolutely blew them all out of the water. The duck was crispy and, I must say, substantial. The kitchen does not scrimp on the portions at all with this dish! The sweet hoisin sauce was a great compliment to the duck and the heat of the sriracha. A definite must-order at Origin.

Next up, we attacked the curried shrimp, which was intensely flavoured and perfectly spicy. The soft, aromatic naan bread sopped up the spicy broth that was left after devouring the plump, juicy shrimp. Another dish that hit its mark!

Finally (and kind of sadly), we came to our last dish: the black cod. Black cod is one my favourite fish and I have it a fair bit. When I was out in Vancouver earlier this year, I had it almost once a day. but this black cod might be the best I've had...ever. It was flaky, tender and moist. The miso glaze was pleasantly salty and the skin, most importantly, was nice and crispy. The soba noodles were served with the ginger vinaigrette and by the time we were done, there was literally nothing left on the plate. In all likelihood, the best dish of the night though the three of us never could decide on a clear winner in that category.

All in all, I would definitely recommend Origin to anyone who has some reasonably adventurous taste buds and who is willing to share. There is one composed plate that makes a meal - a burger combo with Spanish fries and a float. I have no doubt it's delicious, but it seems kind of beside the point of a restaurant like this. Go with friends, go on a date, go with family. It's not a cheap night out, but it is most definitely money well spent.</text></sentence><sentence id="111"><text>Alright, alright, so as it turns out I sometimes judge a book by its cover. Or, in this case, a bar by its' signage. Let's face it, I'm a sucker for good signage. And Souz Dal has it. The rusty globe hangs outside like a relic, the name of the bar cut into the side. Lit, and glowingfrom within, it reminds me of one of those tin punch-out crafts made from a (insert random legume) canat summer camp. But much cooler of course. It was this sign that caught my attention on more than one occasion, beckoning me in when I had somewhere else to be. Finally, one night a couple of weeks ago, I gave in to its sirens call. I was a little bit disappointed.

It was devoid of people save for us and the lonely bartender. I say lonely, butjudging by his charm (see: none) he probably liked it better thatway. Granted though, it was early - Souz Dal only has a drink menu - and a few more folk trickled in as the night wore on.

The stars I gave are attributed solelyto the bar's ambience. Dimly lit, and painted in muted reds and oranges it has an earthy orMoorish feel to it. Worn textiles and cathedral mirrors adorn the walls, while candles flicker on every table, casting shadows. The back patio has a similar vibe happening, cloistered in by high walls, andlit by candles wedged in the mouths of old wine bottles.

Now I rarely turn down a good patio, but in this case I chose aseat inside, which says a lot.Reclined on velvet benches at our table by the open front window, we watched College Street come alive as we perused the drink menu. I was in a cocktail mood, and my friend had read somewhere that Souz Dal claimed to have the "best" mojitos in the city, so that was the first order I placed. 

Now I've been to Cuba. I did a little backpacking, starting in Havanaand makingmy way to the South coast. I wouldn't say I'm a connoiseur of the mojito because of this, but I diddrink my fair share, and like to think I know a thing or two about a good one. And this wasn't one of them. There wasn't nearly enough mint or sugar, so it was overwhelmingly bitter. I don't like my mojitos to taste like Kool-Aid, but I do like a little sweetness to curb the edge. 

Unlikely to order another of the same, but unwilling to give up on the bar, we tried a few other beverages. Nothing wowed us. The Moscow Mule with its ginger beer offered a nice slow burn, but it also wasn't a repeat offender. The fortune cookie garnish on the lychee-infused Soho martini was fun, but not nearly as tasty as a lychee would have been. 

Although funky signage and ambience mean a lot to me, a good drink means even more, so chancesare Iwon't be returning to Souz Dal. If however, you are in the market for an intimate date setting (see: empty bar) then head on over. And if a mediocre mojito is your thing, then you can get them herefor $5.75 on Mondays.</text></sentence><sentence id="112"><text>Away from the hubbub of the Annex and Little Korea, sushi joints become fewer and further between. On a relatively quiet stretch of Bloor West, between Dovercourt and Dufferin, sits Mazz Sushi.

An unassuming neighbourhood favourite for years, Mazz Sushi has been one of the few sushi options for Bloorcourt and Bloordale residents. Each time I visit, I am amazed by how bustling a place it is with the constant turning of tables and the rapid fire filling of take-out bags.

On a recent weeknight excursion, the small dining room was full, with a great mix of students, parents with young children and older couples; a typical audience for Mazz. Soon the servers were trying to accommodate extra guests and pointing out that it would be a '10 to 15 minute wait' for a table.

Seated, with menus in hand, the server soon appeared with the tea that was barely just ordered. Mazz's tea is very earthy in flavour with a hint of barley. Moving on quickly to another table, he left us to continue to ponder the menus, not returning for quite some time.

Upon his return, we quickly placed our order for various maki and sashimi hoping that the busyness of the place wouldn't slow the normally lightning-quick service.

After a moment, he returned with a bowl of congee and an amuse-bouche of marinated tofu. Don't be alarmed, these are Mazz's welcome dishes. I find the tofu pleasant enough, but the congee seems a little too heavy and porridge-like to start a meal.

Before these two were done, he was back again with the ubiquitous Miso soup and house salad. The soup was seasoned and flavourful with lots of nori and tofu. The salad was a small mixture of iceberg lettuce with some vegetable shavings and slices: by the book, but not out of this world.

Just as we were finishing our appetizers, the first of our rolls arrived. We ordered a Spicy Tuna maki: tuna mixed with crumbled tempura and hot sauce. My guest, not a fan of spicy food, likes Mazz's version, as she doesn't normally find it too spicy. Unfortunately this time they were a little too spicy for her. Good for me, but bad for her. A minor thing, but consistency means repeat business.

Next, the rest of our food arrived: a sashimi dinner and Dynamite roll. The sashimi dinner is always a joy at Mazz, and this time was no different. The plate usually contains a nice selection of tuna, white tuna, salmon and possibly mackerel, and always has more pieces then advertised. This time was no different, and the fish was very fresh. The only complaint, and I've found this happens quite regularly in Toronto, is that the white tuna was served too cold. The Dynamite roll was large, but a little tasteless; seemingly prepared in too much of a hurry, a couple of pieces unraveled and fell apart on the plate.

Overall, Mazz Sushi let us down a little on this visit. The staff seemed rushed and unable to provide the consistency that we have come to expect. Not once during our meal were we offered more tea, a slight unheard-of in a sushi restaurant. The food, although served quickly, wasn't up to their usual standards, and the wait to order was long. And although it remains quite inexpensive, the discount on the receipt for paying with cash seems to have disappeared with the updating of cash register system.</text></sentence><sentence id="113"><text>If you've ever driven by High Park on Bloor street, seen the street-level sign that advertises 3 dollar breakfast, and considered stopping in to check it out, you're probably lucky you didn't. Sure, I know the breakfast is only 3 dollars, so I probably shouldn't be hard on it; but regardless of price, I'd still like my meal to be served hot and be put together with some level of care and attention.

This is a pretty mediocre breakfast here: a slice of warm ham, a strip of old bacon, browned toast, over/undercooked eggs, leftover potatoes, breakfast served here is less-than-spectacular, and the service staff doesn't seem to care if you complain about it; I'm sure they've heard it all countless times before.

All of this, of course, is served in one Toronto's prized possessions, High Park. If it wasn't for the location, I certainly would have given them 1 star. In fact, it wasn't for the location, I probably wouldn't have eaten there at all. And in some strange way, I almost wish I didn't eat there. That way, the ad on Bloor street could have remained some mystical promise of a tasty, hot, and friendly-served breakfast somewhere in the heart of High Park.</text></sentence><sentence id="114"><text>Uncle Betty's is a family foodie heaven: the sole Toronto provider of New York's famous Dreesen's doughnuts, a colourful ice cream and dessert bar, warm and fuzzy comfort food, and a small selection of beer and wine for the grown-ups in the crowd, all make this a popular place for parents and kids alike. Uncle Betty's has only been open for a few months, but it already seems to have garnered a dedicated following. We went to Uncle Betty's on a bustling Friday night, looking for a casual meal and easy going atmosphere; Uncle Betty's certainly provided both. Painted in bright blue and cheery orange, lots of seating inside, and a small patio off the front, we felt right at home. Several families were enjoying meals with their kids in tow As the evening wore on though, most of those families were replaced with twenty and thirty-somethings looking for a cool place to hang out.

Offering sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, and many other of Uncle Betty's specialty creations, the menu is fairly extensive and varied. We ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich with a salad, and the grilled cheese sandwich, which was made with homemade mac-and-cheese and meatloaf stuffed inside. Their grilled cheese also comes in a pulled pork variety, which I am sure we will try on our next outing. Both meals were great, the vegetable sandwich was warm, the cheese was nicely melted, and the bread was crisp. The grilled cheeses sandwich was deemed as one of the "best ever," however, the portion size was on the small side for a $15 sandwich. Both of us agreed that the sandwich could be a little bigger, but overall we were impressed with the quality and creative effort put into the food. 

For dessert, we each tried a Dreesen's cinnamon sugar doughnut, made fresh on site, and although they were pretty tasty, I am setting my sights on the ice cream bar next time. It is far too bright and colourful to miss, with jars of candy toppings and a great selection of ice cream flavours to choose from.

The service was friendly and attentive, and we had a conversation with the owner, Samara Melanson, as we were leaving. Samara and her husband recently opened the restaurant, and it's always great to meet the owner while dining out and learn about the creation of the restaurant and where some of the ideas for the food come from. She told us that chef Paul Lampa was brought over from Coquine restaurant, which explains the "gourmet" comfort food bent and the locally sourced ingredients. 

Most appetizers are priced from 6 - 10 dollars; entrees varied in price from about 9 - 15 dollars, and wine and beer was in the 6 - 8 range. And Uncle Betty's carries Kicking Horse coffee, which is an instant sell and a welcome find for this Toronto-transplanted Western girl. 

Betty's also offers what looks to be a delicious weekend brunch, with homestyle blueberry pancake and Uncle Betty's own take on eggs benny, which comes served on a doughnut.  We will definitely be back to Uncle Betty's to try some of the other great entrees on the menu, and  of course to dig into their ice cream bar.</text></sentence><sentence id="115"><text>I am the first to admit that I don't know Roncesvalles Village well. A friend used to live there many moons ago, but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer. In recent years, however, the lure of the restaurants lining Roncesvalles Ave has drawn me to the West side of the city more frequently. I never know quite what to expect when I arrive, but I am always pleasantly surprised.

One such surprise awaited me at The Ace. I had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages; even that it had once been a Chinese restaurant. Now headed up by chef Peter McKnight, it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food: fried chicken, burgers, soup, Shepherd's pie. While the menu has changed, the d&#233;cor most certainly did not; the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950's feel.
My friend and I settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen. When asked what we'd like to drink, I tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight. Well, no taps that I recognized anyway. Our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps.  A great aesthetic touch behind the bar.

We submitted our drink orders - Mill St. for me, the Ace Manhattan for my friend - and took stock of the menu.  Written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose. We pondered several options, but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a "Christmas burger" the whole plan changed. Ground turkey with stuffing in the middle, topped with cranberry chutney? THIS had to be eaten. As delicious as it sounded, it was actually better than anticipated.  It hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes. 

Also sampled were the deep-fried Brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous, briny oysters. Both were truly excellent and personified what The Ace is all about: simple food done perfectly. My dining companion and I nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the Brussels sprouts, something I truly thought would never, ever happen in my lifetime. 

If you're at The Ace, do not miss the fried chicken, which is succulent, juicy and crispy, served with him gravy, collard greens and cornbread (though why the cornbread is served on the gravy is a bit beyond me, as it has the unfortunate effect of making the bread a big soggy after a while). The fresh pasta with tuna, chiles, plum tomatoes and basil was cooked to exactly al dente and the flaked trout with potatoes, radishes and red onions struck a great balance of temperature, texture and flavor. 
No matter how full you may be from the well-sized  portions, I implore you not to skip dessert. The ice cream in particular is outstanding. Do not miss the oatmeal, stout or chocolate-rosemary concoctions: they are all made in-house and I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for an entire vat of the chocolate-rosemary ice cream to take home so that I could swim in it. Seriously. Do not miss dessert!

By the time we left around 8pm, The Ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable, homey environment with excellent comfort food, attentive staff and a great bartender. I would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.  Go early or go late or go for brunch. You won't be disappointed.</text></sentence><sentence id="116"><text>Can I get a Whopper? Not anymore...

A former Burger King at Bathurst and Bloor has become the second Toronto location for the Vancouver dynamo chain. It's easy enough to almost walk past Guu Sakabar--nicknamed Guu 2--as you travel down Bloor Street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows. Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.

Inside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...

This restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.

With that in mind, this has to be one of the most well-trained service and kitchen staff I've ever come across. I went to Guu 2 on a Tuesday evening, and it was jam-packed. Between seating guests, taking orders, delivering orders, cooking, clearing and processing payments, I have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers. Guu has raised the bar for what I believe a well-working service staff is capable of. I will say that a couple of our orders that I consider starters, like salads and sashimi, came out last, but the dishes are small, and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters. The organization and teamwork is impeccable; we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once, a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us. It seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing. Awesome.

Well to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.

A variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a souffl&#233; of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.

One benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.

Quite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it. You may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it.</text></sentence><sentence id="117"><text>Food, like fashion, has a lot to do with trends. Every couple of years some new ingredient or dish seems to capture the attention of cooks everywhere. Someone does it well, and then soon niche restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere.

A number of years ago, it was the burrito, soon the poutine became chic.
Lately it seems like everyone needs to prove they have the best Southern-style barbeque.

On a recent Saturday night, I had the opportunity to eat at Lou Dawg's; Southern Sandwiches at King and Portland in the Entertainment District. Nestled in the basement, Lou Dawg's seems to be punching above its weight. It has a fairly small front of house, and on this night, a third of that front of house seemed to be taken up by an impromptu stage while the sound and light guys were setting up. And once they did, it was loud! Not only that, it wasn't even music. The sound system was blaring an audio feed from the football game projected on the large screen on the opposite wall. Despite that, the place was buzzing. Pretty much all the tables were full and the young-ish crowd that was there seemed to be happy enough, with tables full of plates and pints.

With our large order placed at the bar, we watched a group clear out and quickly snagged the table. No sooner did he drop off our pints did our food arrive. It was super quick, and it couldn't have been more than five minutes. My guests and I ordered the gamut of the menu: pulled chicken, beef brisket, and pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad, coleslaw and a 'Loutine' (poutine with pulled pork). Everything looked great...

The pulled pork had a pleasant smoky flavour and was quite juicy and moist, but after a couple of bites it seemed to be very one note; there wasn't that nice tang you get with true southern barbeque. The pulled chicken was very dry. This is a dish most people have difficulty doing well, and I don't think Lou Dawg's is any different. It seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile... waiting for someone to order it... The beef brisket was popping with flavour. It was succulent, with just the right amount of fattiness. If you're there, I highly recommend it.

Side dishes is where Lou Dawg's really shines. Their coleslaw is creamy, sweet and crisp, with dried cranberries and raisins. And the potato salad? Truly made with love. It burst with flavours of dill and mustard seed, and the potatoes were cooked to the perfect texture.

The small poutine was quite a large portion. The fries were as they should be: crisp and fresh tasting with a hefty salting. If the cheese was curds, you couldn't tell. They had lost all of their consistency from over heating. The chicken gravy was way too salty and overpowered the mild flavour on the pulled pork.

Overall, Lou Dawg's didn't live up to the hype. I've had better Southern barbeque at places that don't specialize in it, and way better at places that do. Coupled with that, the restaurant seemed a little unsure of itself. Is it trying to be a restaurant? a sports bar? or a neighbourhood performance space? or just a hangout for friends of the staff? This indecision usually sounds the death knell of any place. So while the sides and brisket made it a place worth returning to, there wasn't much keeping me from going somewhere else.</text></sentence><sentence id="118"><text>The High Park neighbourhood is near-void of good places to grab a pint. Well, it was until The Mugshot Tavern opened anyways... The Mugshot easily provides the perfect answer to filling that void, and then some. Truly nice owners, delicious food, and a killer environment, this place takes the neighbourhood bar way beyond what it's expected to be.

If the Mugshot doesn't have the best draft selection in a 10 km radius, it certainly has the most well-thought-out one. These guys obviously love beer, and more obviously is that they've put a ton of thought into what is being pulled from the taps. It's all craft beer, and some interesting stuff at that. Chances are they have a few you've never even heard of, like the King Pilsner and Warthog Ale. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that they're probably one of only a handful of places in the city with either on tap. Don't expect to find Canadian or Blue here; what they offer is much more creative than any of that stuff.

The food, and the entire menu for that matter, is equally well-thought out. It's a killer mix of Southern-soul and comfort food, and they do a dam fine job of pulling it off. You can expect to find Southern favorites, like fried chicken with fritters, and some not so expected ones, like in-house-made corn dogs with chutney. The presentation is pretty decent too and again, goes beyond the typical bar stuff. It's pretty obvious that the people manning the kitchen know what the hell they're doing back there. Rarely do I go to a restaurant and have difficulty deciding what to order; at The Mugshot I was torn between a few items.

They've done a dam good job of ridding the place of all remnants of the defunct McKenzies that used to take up the place. They've clearly spent a lot of time, thought, and energy turning it into something completely new. The environment, painted in bright red and tactfully covered in old-school, famous mugshot photos, is easily the kind of space you could hang out for a long, long time. It's comfortable and welcoming, the way a neighbourhood local should be. Despite not being an overly large place, it still accommodates nicely, and any excess people can spill onto their cozy rooftop patio.

And the staff at Mugshot? They couldn't be any friendlier. Having only been open about a week or so, you'd never know it by their attitudes. Likely working long hours, round-the-clock, getting the place ready and established, they're still sociable, out-going, and friendly. I sure-as-hell didn't feel like a stranger in this joint, and I don't think anyone with even the teeniest bit of personality would either. Even coming in by yourself is sure to get you some conversation.

It's clear that, after just opening, they're still trying to establish their crowd. It's still sorta random as to the people that might be in there. While one day the bar could be full of seniors, that evening it could be packed with a younger crowd. It seems to be dependent on the time of day, but it's also, unfortunately, the way the neighbourhood seems to work. Customers are sorta like family; you can't really pick 'em.

The Mugshot isn't just the kind of place you sit, drink, and hide from the world, although it provides that pretty well; it's also the kind of place that you can unexpectedly get some truly imaginative and delicious food in a comfortable and welcoming space. In a neighbourhood like High Park, The Mugshot Tavern is unrivaled in every respect.</text></sentence><sentence id="119"><text>Located at the top of the restaurant strip on Roncesvalles, The Westerly is a cozy neighbourhood spot that is sure to please.  The uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'. Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.

We spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.

After a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon &amp; smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.

When the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.

Between the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.

Amazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.

I would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).  If you haven't been, add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner!</text></sentence><sentence id="120"><text>5 Doors North is my neighbourhood spot. I have visited it on several occasions, and each time I leave, I debate whether sharing this place with the world is worth having to wait for a table during an already busy dinner rush. My conscience prevails, as 5 Doors North is too great of a restaurant not to review, and share with my fellow TOFoodReviews readers.

A spur of the moment, "Thursday night out" decision, led Andy and I to 5 Doors North, knowing we would get a great meal. We were seated in the front area of the dining room, perfect for people watching along the Eglinton-Davisville and Yonge street corridor. The furnishings are worn, kitschy, and mismatched, but only add to the warmth and charm of the restaurant.  The restaurant menu is hand-written and photocopied, followed by an evolving list of specials on the chalkboard, which are carefully selected, and always guaranteed to be great.

The wine list is small and filled with some robust reds. I ordered the Pinot Noir, which I have to say, just didn't do it for me, it was a bit thin and wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Andy's Malbec was fabulous, so we both ordered another glass for the second round. Wines by the glass are anywhere from $7 to $11, and bottles in the $30-$50 range. Overall, wines are priced fairly well, but I would love to see a little more variety to match the diverse food menu.

The appetizer list is long, and everything sounds incredible. They have smoked salmon, Prosciutto, mussels, a delicious polenta dish, on top of the list of daily specials, which included cauliflower soup, avocado bruschetta, and crab cakes. We went with the soup, beef Carpaccio with Pecorino cheese &amp; roasted onion, and the beet salad. First out was the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli &amp; lotus chips, which was wonderful, the goat cheese soft and warm, and the beets sweet and crunchy. The roasted cauliflower soup was smoky and creamy, but not too heavy; a perfect start to the meal, and the beef Carpaccio was some of the best, the cheese and onion offsetting the beef perfectly.

For our mains, I ordered the gnocchi Gorgonzola special and Andy the braised brisket ravioli. The meals were incredible. The gnocchi was awesome, fresh and soft, but the real winner was the Gorgonzola cream sauce. So creamy, it certainly blew my cheese calorie allotment for the week, but so worth it. Garnished with scallions and fresh pepper, the meal needed nothing more to bring out the strong flavours in the Gorgonzola.

The braised brisket ravioli was probably one of the more interesting meals we have ever had. I was unsure what to expect, but the beef was perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, wrapped in fresh pasta, with beef au jus and cream to make up the ravioli sauce. It would be worth phoning in advance to see if this was on the specials menu, as this dish just has to be tried.

The prices are right, entr&#233;es run from $14-$20, with appetizers in the $8-$12 range. The service is extremely friendly, with everyone pitching in to seat, serve and check-in. It's a family run restaurant, and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 Doors North as much as you will.</text></sentence><sentence id="121"><text>Bamburger is the latest entry into the inexpensive "gourmet burger" trend taking over Yonge Street, including Gourmet Burger Co., South Street Burger Co., Burger Shoppe and Gourmet Burger.

While Bamburger offers a decent take-out menu, we chose to enjoy their small, but friendly sidewalk patio, right in the middle of restaurant row at Yonge and Davisville. Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed "diner" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.

Starting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.

The menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is "Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50)," and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!

We went with the "Bambamburger ($11.50)," which is 2/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the "Bambamburger," and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.

Bamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.

If you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.</text></sentence><sentence id="122"><text>One of the worst bar experiences I've ever had. The servers don't care if you're there, and they probably wouldn't care if you showed up at all. They're far too busy chatting with each other about how beautiful and amazing and important they are to care about customers. Avoid...</text></sentence><sentence id="123"><text>I know some people are going to completely disagree with my 1 star rating here, and to be honest, 10 years ago I would have thought the same; but considering how much the culture of Greek food on the Danforth has evolved in the past 10 years, Mr Greek seems to have been left far, far behind.

Mr Greek has slid to becoming nothing more than a glorified cafeteria. That might actually be giving it more credit than it deserves though, because I've been to some cafeterias that aren't absolutely horrible.

I remember stopping in there in the past and having some pretty decent souvlaki, but what you're presented with now is nothing close to decent. The souvlaki is tough and tasteless, the rice is lukewarm and overcooked, the vegetables were likely previously frozen; bottom line is, this is in no way an accurate representation of what Greek food is in Toronto. Add in the sweaty, pushy serving staff, and you have an all around poor dining experience.

I actually complained via email last time I went, and I promptly received an email back from the owner full of profuse apologies and promises of a better meal, nicer service and an overall better experience if I returned. Although I appreciated his effort, the last thing I want is to be forced another meal there. I know restaurants can have a bad day, and I'm willing to overlook that. But from what I saw, this was just another day in the life of crappy restaurant living of it's achievements in the distant past.

On a street with as many options as the Danforth, there's absolutley no reason (or excuse!) to end up in this joint.</text></sentence><sentence id="124"><text>Since it opened, this place has become a West Toronto local favourite. And what's not to love? HUGE slices with fresh ingredients at reasonable prices. While I defintely have had better pizza before, for something quick, fairly inexpensive and reasonably tasty, there isn't much within walking distance that beats it. Just stay away at noon during the week, or the highschool crowd will eat you alive. 

If you can't make it in, they have delivery available too.</text></sentence><sentence id="125"><text>Having a craving for something spiced and exotic and motivated by a friend's comments that, "there is a good Indian place over on Queen," I ventured out in hopes of finding something deliciously curried. Upon arrival we found that this is an odd spot on Queen West where a string of three of four Indian restaurants are all lined up side-by-side, so which to choose?

One thing I love about Toronto restaurants that you won't always find in smaller cities are menus posted on the outside of the building.  Little India stood out for it's well-organized, easy to understand and well-priced menu - in we went.

It is definitely an intimate spot, having no real capacity to hold very large groups, but was still quite comfortable for our dining duo. It was a cold Thursday night and not overly busy, so it did not feel crowded, and it gave the servers that much more time to be attentive.

The menu is substantial and has a variety of dishes. The price range is about $15 - $20 for an entr&#233;e, but be sure to ask which ones come with rice or Naan and which don't so that you can order them on the side.  First up was the mixed platter appetizer, which included samosas, onion bhajia, pakora and spring rolls. Everything was crispy, hot and just the right size for something before the entr&#233;e-and it came in at under $5.

For the main, I ordered the chicken kebab and my dinner partner had the Madras chicken.  Fair warning: if they tell you it's going to be hot, then it's truly hot.  We are all too accustomed to those Canadian-ized restaurants that tone down their spiciness to appease the masses, and it is arguable that Little India may do this too, but in any case, take the servers' recommendations to heart.  I do enjoy some heat, but my taste buds can't handle extremes, so I steered clear on this occasion-except for a little taste of the Madras.  For those of you who do like spice, you'll love this!  It has that heat that creeps up after a few bites, not that punch-in-the-face-burn that you might get from cheap chicken wings covered in Frank's Red Hot. Our server did lean my friend toward the less-spicy of the dishes she was deciding between at first, much to her dismay, but as it turns out his suggestion right on.  As for my tamer dish, it had more of a Mediterranean flavour to it; grilled, lemony and came with a cucumber salad garnished with cilantro.  It was a happy reminder of summer while dining in the depths of winter.

One of the greatest things about this restaurant is something I was not even able to take advantage of: the lunch buffet.  This is a bit of a hike from my own home and workplace, but for those of you in the area, I say go for it!  Buffets have a bit of a bad reputation (and for the most part it's well-deserved), but a small arrangement at a non-chain location like this can be a perfect opportunity to try a variety of what is on the menu, especially if it is food you're mostly unfamiliar with.

Overall, I can't leave you saying it was the very best Indian cuisine I've ever had, but I can say that I wasn't disappointed, and I would go back again-especially for that buffet.</text></sentence><sentence id="126"><text>I heart churros.  At least that's what the button said that was given to me by the man behind the counter at Pancho's Bakery.  After noticing the small collection I have attached to both my bag and jacket, he was quick to give me a new addition.  I was hesitant to let it join the ranks, after all "I heart" anything is a pretty bold statement, and to be honest, as of that moment, I had never had a mind blowing churro experience, or at least one that would have me declaring such strong feelings for them.  The only time I ever ate a churro was at an establishment once promoted by a talking Chihuahua, so you can understand my hesitation.  I pocketed the button, as its fate would be determined later.

Pancho's Bakery makes up a portion of what is titled the Latin American Food Court in Kensington Market.  The tiny little storefront on Augusta Avenue is deceiving, as it houses more businesses than I would have guessed.  Assuming it was only Pancho's in the building, I was surprised (and excited) to see a stall selling tacos, another dealing in empanadas, and the infamous pop-up Agave y Aguacate.  Pancho's itself occupies the space right up front, across from the Korean dumpling stand... I'm not sure exactly how they fit in.  Apparently the Latin American Food Court doesn't discriminate, and why should they?  Dumplings are tasty, and well, I'm sure another vendor only helps pay the rent.

It was around twelve o'clock on a Friday when my friend and I decided to check out Pancho's. Neither of us had eaten, but we couldn't quite justify having churros for lunch. We are of the mindset however, that believes dinner shouldn't be the only meal followed by dessert, so our afternoon repast that day would have a churro chaser.

Full of carnitas tacos, and kimchi empanadas (Korean dumpling cart influence!), but not too full to pass up deep-fried dough, we made our way back to Pancho's.  I was promptly questioned as to the whereabouts of my button but I quickly placed my order as a distraction.

The churros at Pancho's are piped out in the front window, and brought to life for all too see, before quickly being led to their delicious demise in the deep fryer.  They are served hot, either plain or filled with your choice of chocolate, dulce de leche or strawberry syrup.  We ordered four, one of each flavour, and a plain.  At my servers recommendation I also grabbed some bread pudding and traditional Mexican concha bread.  As we had lost our seats (there aren't many to begin with) and the sun was shining, we took our treats to go.

We started with the chocolate, moved on to the dulce de leche, followed by the strawberry, and thus ended anticlimactically with the plain. They were crispy and sugar coated on the outside, while soft and (with the exception of the plain) accompanied with a burst of sweetness from within. Churro rookies be warned... a churro is a like a deep fried dough straw.  Any filling that goes in the top, will ultimately come out the bottom.  We left a sticky trail through the streets of Kensington that led back to Pancho's.  If Hansel and Gretel only knew about these, they would have rethought the breadcrumb idea.

Later at home, I popped the bread pudding and concha into the oven.  Concha is a sweet bread that resembles a clam shell, hence the name.  It tasted a little of brown sugar, but overall it was bland.  I think the idea however is to serve it alongside a cup of caf&#233; con leche or hot chocolate and get to dunking.  I could see this working in its favour.

The bread pudding however (traditionally served around this time of year to be eaten for Lent) was delicious.  Dense, but very moist, and just sweet enough, my girlfriend went nuts over it. Apparently she doesn't have a problem with dessert after other meals either - and this time it was breakfast.

Now I'm not a fan of donuts, and the churro is essentially the donuts Spanish cousin, but I would take a Pancho's churro over a donut any day, and these are what I will return for.  As it turns out, I really do "heart" churros after all.  Now where did I put that button?</text></sentence><sentence id="127"><text>We were invited last week to attend a new menu tasting event at &amp;Company Resto Bar in Mississauga (across from Square One Shopping Center).

First impressions were that this restaurant is HUGE. It's a good spot if you are looking to throw a large-group party or corporate event dinner. They definitely have room to accommodate large groups for dinner and drinks.

The menu is set up with shareable appetizers as well as traditional entrees. We tried a variety of starters, all which ranged from $13.50 to $16.50.

First, we tried the Louisiana Shrimp Po Boys. This sharable serving came with three Po boy sliders, along with a helping of fries. The shrimp were lightly spiced instead of battered like a traditional po'boy sandwich, and were served with creole tartar sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. The buns were a bit oversized for the shrimp in the sandwiches. Something tells me they are better suited for the hamburger sliders also on the menu.

Next up for appetizers is the Charcuterie Flatbread. This was a great value! The flatbread that came to our table was the size of a small pizza. Each of us had a few pieces, which is a great size for an appetizer. As a big fan of a traditional charcuterie board I was interested in trying this out, and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was not overpowered by the cheese, tomato and sauce base on the flatbread. Would highly recommend this one!

Traditional entrees were next... I tried the Surf n Turf, a new menu item, which was $29. I really liked the unique presentation, which each item set up on a long board instead of a traditional steak and potatoes plate. The steak was cooked exactly as I requested. The lobster tail was a generous size, and the lemon-garlic butter sauce wasn't overpowering at all. It was cooked perfectly too and was very meaty.

Unfortunately, the double cheese baked potato was very dry. It seems like they are premade and had cheese, asparagus, and shallots added and reheated. A simply baked potato would have been a better choice for this one. The attempt at an added flair didn't add much to this dish.

Under recommendation from our waitress, we also tried the Penne Jambalaya. This huge helping of pasta came with big chunks of chorizo, chicken breast and shrimp, in a Sambucca Cajun cream sauce. The sauce tasted a lot like vodka sauce, for those who have never tried Sambucca before. The portion size was impressive, and the pasta had a good kick of spice to it too. Definitely a win, and at $19 it was well worth it.

Once 10pm hit, the music was turned up to a deafening level, and other tables of guests began to arrive, including a few party groups with bottle service for the night. We decided it was time to ask for dessert so we could head on our way. The Brownie Cookie Stack arrived at our table with fanfare. A huge firework candle drew the attention from the tables around us as it arrived. It would be great for a birthday party or function, but as a regular dessert accompaniment it was a little over the top. Again, we were pleasantly surprised by the portion size, a stack of 4 huge, thick brownie and chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream and raspberry drizzle, all for $10. Although the presentation was amazing, the ice cream and sauce just couldn't bring out enough from the cookies, which were warm but weren't very moist or chewy.

Overall, the food is comparable to a lot of nightclub-restaurants on King Street in Toronto but at a more affordable price range, and without the 60-minute wait for a table. The service was great, from the manager to the hostesses we felt very welcomed at the restaurant. &amp;Company would be an awesome spot to celebrate your birthday, family function or company party but if you are looking for an intimate dinner party or a romantic evening, this might not be the best choice.</text></sentence><sentence id="128"><text>Joy Bistro is a beautiful, sophisticated resto just inside Leslieville on Toronto's East side. It's likely that you've heard of it, or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage. It's become somewhat of a Leslieville landmark.

First things first, I've heard a lot of negative comments about this place. By the sounds of it, it's one of those places that's hit-or-miss and completely different from one visit to the next; amazing one time, awful the next. Because I've never had dinner there, I can't vouch for evening dining, but I can say this: if you truly don't want run the risk of being disappointed, stick with their weekend brunch. This place is known for brunch. While they may have their issues, Joy Bistro has no problems delivering an upscale brunch experience that is chock full of style.

Brunch at Joy Bistro is not really bistro-ish. The brunch food here is mostly just what you'd expect to see on a brunch menu in most Toronto restaurants, but they do their brunch stuff particularly well. Eggs benny is served up in numerous styles like Benetine (with spinach and peameal bacon), Norwegien (with stacked smoked salmon), and Teddy (with peameal bacon, roasted tomatoes, and spinach). With their near-perfect hollandaise, eggs benny at Joy Bistro is a solid choice.

That, and they've got a killer patio. Intimate and relaxing, their patio is probably one of the best things about this place and the likely reason that a lot of people still frequent it even after having poor experiences. Leslieville has got a few patio spots, but for sheer space, warmth, and location sitting on a busy little Leslieville corner overlooking Jimmie Simpson Park, Joy Bistro's patio is in a league of its own. Worth the sit down in the summer.

They've recently undergone mass renos, which has resulted in Joy Bistro Bar. Although this may have helped the space modernize, it's also contributed to changing their clientele base. Neighbourhood locals that frequented Joy over the years seem to have gone looking for other spots while those looking for a more trendy experience seem to take over. I guess as Leslieville becomes more popular, Joy Bistro wants to change with the nighbourhood, and while change can be good, in most cases, if it isn't broke them why fix it?

Despite that new clientele, it's still a great place for brunch. So the next time a nice, summer weekend rolls around, head out to Joy Bistro for brunch on the patio. By the sounds of it though, I certainly wouldn't do anything but brunch.</text></sentence><sentence id="129"><text>So lately I've been on a bit of an Italian kick. Maybe its the changing of the seasons, and I'm subconsciously trying to carbo-load for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation. Whatever it is, this past Monday I was looking for just that at Terroni on Queen West.
 
The camp is divided on Terroni. People either rave about it or complain about the pretentious servers, the 'no-substitution' rule, or the slice-it-yourself pizza. Being a fan of this place, I have a rebuttal for each of these complaints. 

While (some of) the servers may seem a bit curt at first, I owe this to the fact that Terroni is busy - always busy - and their no-nonsense attitude is often mistaken for pretentiousness. Our server, although brusque, took our order diligently while complementing our choices, had our wine to the table in no time, and managed to pour two glasses of the stuff from the awkwardly shaped porcelain decanter without dribbling it everywhere (which is something we later failed to do). 

As for the no-subsitutions rule, if you want to choose your own toppings, then head on down to that infamous sub-par pizza joint (you know the one...with its orange boxes and redundant title) and stuff your crust while you're at it. Since when did slicing pizza become a chore? Just a few simple back and forth motions with a knife and voila! Freshly sliced pizza.  
  
Regardless of the division, Terroni is always packed. Monday at 9:00 found us one free table upstairs, which was where our preference lay anyway. Although I do love to pull up to the bar, it tends to get a bit clustered on the lower level, and while the upstairs isn't exactly quiet, shouting across the table isn't required. 

Our waiter promptly brought us the menus and we poured over the apps and the twenty-nine - yes, twenty-nine - pizzas they have to offer.  

We started with the Funghi Assoluti ($12.95):  breaded and baked oyster mushrooms served on arugula, sprinkled with parmesan, and drizzled with a balsamic glaze.  It was superb, but sharing proved to be problematic, not because the portion wasn't large enough, but because we simply didn't want to. Social graces saved us, but I had visions of the two of us in an Animal Planet-esque showdown... circling the last mushroom with fangs bared and hackles raised. 
 
We chased all of this down with a velvety Piemonte that was oddly served in a jug, which made it difficult to pour. Our server made it look effortless, but us? Well, we just made a mess. I did manage to solve the problem however (pour from the side, and not from the oddly shaped lip) and fortunately for us we had a seemingly bottomless half litre.
 
No sooner had we finished sharing the last 'shroom was our pizza delivered to the table. We went with the Primavera ($15.95) to contribute to our daily recommended dose of veggies and to somehow convince ourselves that we were being healthy. All of the pizza at Terroni is thin crust and ours was weighed down heavily with tomatoes, red pepper, (more) mushrooms, and artichokes with a few black olives decorating the centre of the pie. 

Now when I say thin-crust, I mean it.  Maybe I'm just speaking for myself here, but I have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at Terroni. I'm a big fan of folding slices before biting into them, and the crust at Terroni is so thin and pliable I always envision myself folding a whole pizza in half,...and then in half again...and then having my way with it.  Once again, as with the sharing, social norms seem to get in the way...</text></sentence><sentence id="130"><text>Torontonians have welcomed Momofuku with open arms and with satisfied stomachs. Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman", and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&amp;A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.

Three hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...

Momofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC &amp; Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.

With the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.

As you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.

First we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!

Next came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!

We then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and crudit&#233;; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.

And then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.

Lastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,

We decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.

All in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic. Good friends and good food - what could be better?</text></sentence><sentence id="131"><text>Much like Ed Ho's recent earth Bloor West endeavour, Globe bistro's focus is on local and simple; myself, I find that to be a beautiful combination, if it's pulled off right that is.

Cut off from the cozy front bar space, you can't help but notice how welcoming Globe's dining room is; distinguishingly set tables, character hardwood floors, and an interesting play on shadows and lighting all come together to create a soft and intimate space. It draws you in as soon as you enter, and it gives you the feeling that you're in for something special.

With considerate, friendly, detail orientated staff, the service at Globe doesn't disappoint. While it might have partly been because we were among the first tables they had in for dinner that night, we were warmly greeted by the entire front house as we were led to our table. No matter what business you're in, that type of attention scores big points.

Trouble is, I was there to eat, and most of the food at Globe fell a little flat...
There's a lot to be said about going local. With hype from the 100 Mile Challenege and a seemingly growing concern for eating local and sustainable, people are looking for food that's produced closer to home and with a smaller carbon footprint. While Globe's focus may be on local, it's hard to identify exactly how close 'local' is since they have items sourced from as far as Kelowna and Vancouver.

The West Coast Dungeness Crab starter was overcomplicated, which made it slightly hard to identify what the heck we were eating. Besides the obvious crab meat, which was subtly sweet and perfectly cooked, the plate also had a far-to-large savoury panna cotta and some haphazardly scattered popcorn. Yep. Popcorn. While the consistencies were actually pretty good, it was mostly a confusing dish to eat that came with no explanation.

The Second Winds Farm Elk main was a little too simple; too little color, not enough flavor, and effortless presentation. While the elk loin was perfectly cooked, the braised shoulder was tough and near-tasteless. The best part of the dish was the corn polenta.

Much the same with the pheasant, which also served the meat two ways. While the citrus breast was moist and tasty, the jerked leg was tough and lacking spices.
It's really too bad, because I truly wanted to love Globe. From the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff, I was sure I was in for something special.

Perhaps simpler is better, especially since what we're talking about here is a focus on local ingredients. Great cooking is all about balance, and if Globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes (like the crab starter) and making others slightly more complicated (like the Elk main) and identify where they draw the line on being local, they'd have nothing stopping them.</text></sentence><sentence id="132"><text>For those that don't know, O.Noir is that unique place where you dine entirely in the dark. Yes, it is completely pitch-black, and no, your eyes will not eventually adjust. You can't see a dam thing down there in O.Noir's dark and dingy basement dining room.

Seriously though, O.Noir is easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Toronto, not just because the food and service were awful, but also because I left the place feeling ripped off. O.Noir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it. It was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights off.

First off, the food at O.Noir is horrible. It's just glorified, hotel banquet food. You know the stuff: salad with balsamic vinaigrette, pre-cooked steam-table-held vegetables, chicken with coriander sauce. It was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s; there's nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here. The food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light. You'd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight, they'd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses, like food with strong aromas or flavours. Nope. Just unthoughtful, crappy food. In a way, the food was so bad that I'm glad my other senses weren't heightened by the lack of light.

I ordered the 'surprise' menu. I mean really, why wouldn't I? I'd like to at least try to see if I could use my 'enhanced' senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was I was eating... For me, the 'surprise' was that I still don't know what the hell I ate. No one ever told me. I sort of assumed that once we were finished eating, the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions, but nope, he just took our plates away without any explanation at all.

Speaking of our server, he was one of the worst in the biz. Not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up, but he was inattentive and bored; I don't blame him though, it'd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of O.Noir. He often left us wondering where he was, not because we were in the dark, but because he often left the room or crept up behind us.

The seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too, especially if you're part of a group. In a dark environment, you'd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation. Our seating arrangements at a long, rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alone.

Sitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too. Believe it or not, the servers actually signal that they're entering the room by banging on the door. We must have heard it 40 or 50 times. In a room that is supposed to heighten your senses, this seems absolutely ridiculous. Surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters. If there is, O.Noir didn't figure it out, or they didn't care. They just decided to stick with the loud banging.

Although we couldn't see anything, a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotel-style metal chairs and wooden tables. I mean, I know we can't see anything anyways, but if our senses were supposed to be heightened, then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that. You could argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant doesn't need to spend as much on the space, but I'd argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into consideration.

On the way out, the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel, and right then, it all made sense to me; this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel. It explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture. It confirmed one thing for me: if you're going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark, then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose. There's little doubt that because they didn't, O.Noir sees little repeat business. People come for the novelty, but likely leave disappointed.

O.Noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that. The pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway. I was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark...</text></sentence><sentence id="133"><text>Having grown up enjoying pubs far and wide, it doesn't take much to cajole me into visiting the newest local for a pint and bite to eat. This was the case a few days back when a number of friends thought it would be fun to get together at Axis Gastropub on the corner of Bloor and Markham in Mirvish Village.

Axis sits in the old Rocco's Plum Tomato location and is the sister pub to Axis Gallery and Grill in the Junction. This corner seems to be one of the those 'Bermuda Triangle' hospitality locations, with new establishments failing to get a foothold over and over again. Maybe the Axis folks will succeed where others have not.

Arriving, a number of us remarked that the large room, decorated in a modern style, was a little stark and very empty for the time of day. It certainly didn't scream 'Pub'.

Within seconds we were greeted by the two servers/bartenders and warmly directed to sit wherever we'd like. Both of these guys seemed genuinely happy to see us and quickly told us about the pint special for the day.

Taking a large table in the back of the room, we sat, chatted and waited for our drinks that soon appeared.

Perusing the menu, it was soon clear that this place was trying to please everyone. The choice was almost limitless with the usual pub fare coupled with 'build your own' pizzas and an entrees list that went from curries to fish and all the way back to steak and pasta.

At the server's recommendation we tried the Pulled Pork Nachos. What came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings. Tasty, but not remarkable in any way, and the amount of topping-less dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing. Hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of: 'Okay', 'Not stellar', 'Not that spicy'. Following another suggestion, my Axis Club sandwich soon arrived. A Pub staple, the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs. This club was well prepared, but again not remarkable. Combining chicken breast, ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard, much like what you'd find in a veteran diner or truck stop.

Overall, Axis Gastropub does not live up to its name. It doesn't really feel like a Pub and there isn't anything remarkable about the food. Maybe it is a case of higher expectations, but I can't imagine returning when there are so many other better options nearby.</text></sentence><sentence id="134"><text>Sometimes I ride the 501 streetcar just for something to do.  It's a fun way to people watch, without really having to watch out for them, but it's also a great way to spot new businesses, or old ones for that matter.  The past couple of times I took this trip, I wondered what was in the chalkboard-black building on the corner of Queen and Elm Grove.  I assumed it was a gallery given it was such a big space, and I was half right.  The Mascot is a coffee shop that showcases art...or an art gallery that serves coffee, depending on what you're going for I guess.  I myself was going for the coffee.

At first the place is a bit daunting.  It's quite large, with a lot of negative space, and very limited seating.  There are two barstools at the counter, a few tables that can seat more than one, and a surprisingly comfy blue velvet couch in the front room, but patrons need to be ready to get creative if all of those are taken.  The back room, which houses the artwork offers up a couple Victorian chairs for those who feel like working on their posture, an old elementary school chair/desk combo, and a springy antique rocking horse (???).  I'm not quite sure if that last option is for display only, or for those who like their coffee with a little bouncy nostalgia, but I for one wasn't about to find out.  I used to have one of those horses, and I remember getting pinched by the damn springs on a regular basis.  Luckily for us, there was a free table.

My girlfriend ordered a latte while I went with just a basic drip to see what Reunion Island coffee is like in its most vulnerable state.  I should've went with the latte.  Not that the drip was bad, but the latte was fantastic. It was smooth and strong without being bitter. The Rosetta adorning the foam was a nice touch as well.  (It should be noted that I went back a few days later for my very own).  

As it was around the brunch hour, and breakfast had long worn off we decided to get a couple of treats to go with our coffee.  The edible portion of the menu at The Mascot is provided by OMG Baked Goods, and like the seating, selection is limited.  The cupcakes were tempting but we were in the mood for savoury, so we ordered a ham &amp; cheese quiche along with a stuffed foccacia.

The quiche arrived looking a little bit sad and we faced off as to who would try it first.  We both agreed that it was tastier than we would have guessed, but I've definitely had better quiche.  The stuffed foccacia on the other hand was a nice surprise.  It didn't come to the table looking like much... really just a bun on a plate.  But as with all things stuffed, it's what's inside that counts.  Filled with roasted peppers, artichokes and Asiago cheese, it was not unlike a grown-up Hot Pocket...one that got tired of all the negative attention so it moved out of its parents freezer, and adopted a healthier lifestyle.  The quiche was pushed aside, but later finished - out of hunger alone. 

Food however is an afterthought at The Mascot.  From what I saw, the people of Parkdale go for the coffee, and rightly so.  There was a steady stream of people coming and going, and judging by the interactions, quite a few regulars.  With friendly laid-back staff, good ambience and amazing lattes, I would make it my local too - if only I lived anywhere near it.

Footnote:  Seating doubles in the warmer months, when it's comfortable enough to sit on the driftwood looking bench that runs the length of their storefront.  Another good place to do some people watching.</text></sentence><sentence id="135"><text>Utopia Cafe and Grill is aptly named. Let me tell you why... One hot and muggy Saturday evening, I found myself walking down College Street in search of sustenance and something cold to slake my thirst. Now, I'm notorious for my inability to make a decision when faced with many options, and College Street has a lot to offer in the way of restaurants. I passed by bistro after restaurant after lounge, growing hungrier by the minute. How did I choose? Divine intervention lent me a helping hand as the sky opened up and let loose a torrential downpour sending me running into the open arms (see: doorway) of Utopia.

It was already jam packed, which had nothing to do with the rain. There was a line-up for tables, but I managed to grab a seat at the bar to peruse both the menu and the environment. What is it about exposed brick and hardwood floors that make a place so cozy? Whatever it is, Utopia has both.

Needless to say, I was immediately enamoured, and when I opened the menu, that bubble remained intact. Now, I wouldn't call myself a vegetarian, nor would I dive into a steak with gusto, so for a selectavarian such as myself, I couldn't have designed a more heavenly menu if I tried. All but three of their appetizers are meat free, and they allow you to substitute soy (grilled or breaded &amp; fried) for meat in most of their main dishes. Meat lovers and vegetarians unite!

And if that wasn't enough, it gets even better! I forgot to mention earlier that in between appreciating the exposed brick and opening the menu, I honed in on the beer selection (tunnel vision at its finest). And it made me smile, for they had KLB Raspberry Wheat on tap. Typically, I like my beer to taste like, well...beer, but I make an exception for KLB, especially in the summertime (although I find excuses to drink it at other points in the year) as the natural raspberry essence paired with the beer itself is possibly the most refreshing combination ever. Like angels dancing on my tongue...delicious, raspberry angels. Its difficult to find on tap, and Utopia has it, so I chalk them up some more points.

I started with the Mumahari Dip (roasted red peppers, pomegranate molasses and walnuts) that comes served with naan. While the dip itself wasn't exactly visually appealing (but really how many dips are?) with a likening to cat food, I was willing to overlook it. The Everlasting Gobstopper of dips, every bite of the Mumahari started sweet, moved onto nutty and finished with a bit of a kick. Delish.

Between the dip and the KLB, I was already very satisfied, but I wasn't done yet. Next came my Grilled Veggie &amp; Goat Cheese Burrito. I love a good burrito, and this one didn't disappoint. Grilled zucchini, red peppers, eggplant, onions and a generous layer of goat cheese came wrapped in a soft tortilla. Served alongside substantial sides of both garden salad and rice, I couldn't finish it if I tried...and I tried. There is absolutely nothing wrong with leftovers though, and I can vouch that a Utopia burrito tastes just as delicious the day after.

On a tight budget? All of Utopia's mains hover around the $13 mark which in my opinion is a great deal considering the quality of the food and the very sizeable portions. I can easily see two people splitting a burrito and leaving the place with full stomachs (and wallets). The only problem with this scenario however, is the lack of leftovers.

If Utopia has any drawbacks, it's that the place is hot in the summer - really, really hot. The lack of air-conditioning combined with the open kitchen may have something to do with it. If I were anywhere else, I just may have been uncomfortable, but I had my pint of KLB, exposed brick, and a smiling bartender that made me feel like I was the only person in the room (okay...now I'm just getting carried away, but that being said the service is genuinely warm). Looking around, even though everyone had a sheen to them, nobody seemed to mind. Everybody just looked happy. People don't sweat at Utopia...they glow.

For a pasta-heavy neighbourhood, Utopia provides a nice deviation. It's the kind of place I could eat at everyday, so it's probably a good thing I don't live nearby, but it will definitely be my College Street go-to. They also have a four season patio (another good reason I don't live in the area, as much to my liver's chagrin, I have an almost instinctual draw to drinking outside).

Utopia is a contradiction unto itself: it's frenetic, but it's calm; blazers sit next to longboarders; meat lovers co-exist amongst vegetarians; it's hot, but oh so cool. As its name implies, this Bohemian spot in Little Italy is truly ideal.</text></sentence><sentence id="136"><text>Beautifully modern and discerning, Nota Bene provides the perfect setting for special occasions and casual dining alike. What makes the experience at Nota Bene so incredible is the total lack of pretense in a restaurant that could easily come across as pompous, and still attract a devoted clientele.

You might find yourself dining with a local politician or celebrity, and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary, all in the same place. The price is accessible, the quality of the food impeccable, and the service instant without being overwhelming.

We started the evening with Chef David's lobster tacos and the margarita fiesta specials. The lobster tacos were served in a lettuce shell, with a chipotle cream, veggies and cilantro ($8). They tasted like something you would find in a great coastal city, and not at all heavy. The lobster special is a great way to settle in to a long evening of wonderful food.  The margaritas were phenomenal, served on the rocks with Avion tequila. We tried a couple of the cocktails and loved "Chef David's" traditional margarita with smoked sea salt. The blueberry and pine tips margarita sounds like a bit of an odd marriage, but worked so wonderfully together that we ordered another.

For appetizers we started with the Hamachi ceviche, which is a yellowtail Pacific fish, infused with coriander, lime, avocado, and jalape&#241;o ($16). This dish came highly recommended by our server, and was absolutely worth the hype. The jalape&#241;os offered a very spicy take on the dish, tempered by the avocado and lime.

Next we tried the cavatelli pasta, with a truffle-scented mushroom Bolognese ($16). This dish was surprisingly soft and creamy without any cheese in it, and the truffle mushrooms were divine. We also had the crisp duck salad with sumac green papaya slaw and cashews ($15), and although I am self-admittedly duck averse, I am told it was perfectly crispy and flavourful, and ending up being the favourite appetizer of the evening for my companion.

For our mains we ordered two Nota Bene favourites. I went with the wild Digby sea scallops with avocado pur&#233;e, Thai curry paste, mango, papaya and peanut salad ($28). For such a tropical sounding dish, the scallops actually had a very Canadian East coast feel to them, the avocado puree adding a creamy compliment to the scallops. Nota Bene specializes in preparing excellent seafood, and I would absolutely come back for this dish again.

We also tried the braised beef short rib with corn truffle, pickled red onions, queso a&#241;ejo and coriander ($29). The short ribs were tender, succulent and combined with the sharp taste of the queso a&#241;ejo and the acidity of the pickled red onion, they were layered with flavour and flat out delicious.

With dinner, we ordered a glass of Ontario Pinot Noir and an Argentinean Malbec. The wine list at Nota Bene is extensive, with the full spectrum of bottles, ranging from the $70 to several hundred.

For dessert we sampled sticky toffee pudding ($12) and S'More ice cream ($10). Needless to say, the sampling turned into finishing. Both desserts were exploding with flavour, the pudding a great combination of traditional pecan praline and spotted dick ice cream, taken with a strong espresso; this is dessert to die for. The S'More ice cream was a fun take on the campfire favourite, with a chocolate and graham cracker crumble.

Go try Nota Bene, twice.  Once to become familiar with all that this brilliantly conceived restaurant has to offer and then a second time to cement the relationship in your black book of regular haunts. Service, quality and ambience are all top rate, yet you still feel the passion Nota Bene has for creating a wonderful experience and forming personal relationships with its guests.

See you there...</text></sentence><sentence id="137"><text>Geez. I just cant figure it out. I've been looking through what other people have said about Megas, and it's all so bad...really bad. That's where the trouble comes in for me, because I certainly didn't hate it as much as everyone else seems to. In fact, I actually thought I was going to be giving Megas more then 3 stars with this review. Why? This is the second time I've been to Megas. I was only going again because it was so good the first time. But the second time wasn't even a close second.

The big plus Megas has got going for them is their killer patio right on the busier stretch of the Danforth. It's probably one of the best places to sit outdoors on the street. It's a big, covered space that's chock full of people, and at first glance, is difficult not to gravitate towards on a sunny day. 

Once you get over the patio though, and it comes to eating, you're likely to be disappointed; but it's completely dependent on what you order and when you order it. The food at Megas is mostly mediocre, but there are a couple things worth mentioning. While the rice is of the reheated, overcooked, slightly warmed kind, the Saganaki (fried Feta cheese made of sheep's milk) and Taramosalata (Cod caviar spread) is probably some of the best on The Danforth. Seriously, if you have never tried either of these, this is the place to do it. But everything else, order with caution. This place is completely hit or miss, mostly depending on how busy they are.

The inside is sorta your typical Greek place: fake roman statues, stone pillars, and lots of greenery; it's a big space too. If you check it out on the weekend, chances are that big space will have more than one big group, which Megas can provide for comfortably. But that's where most of their issues lie. While they may be able to provide for big groups, it's at the sacrifice of all the other tables. Once Megas gets busy, the service, food quality, and overall experience seemingly drops right through the floor.

Unfortunately, the one thing that is truly consistent at Megas no matter how many times you go there is their lack of caring for food presentation. While most of the stuff they serve seems to be haphazardly dropped on the plate, I don't blame Megas for that. After all, that's pretty much a standard for Greek food; it never seems to be about the presentation. When it comes to Greek food, there's never really a big surprise with what you end up with at your table. You order calamari? It's probably served garnished with parsley and olive oil. You order hummus? It's probably served garnished with olive oil and a lone Kalmata olive. The only difference varying from place to place is whether it's tasty enough to be worth eating.

I'm still slightly confused about whether to recommend this place or not. I mean, they've got a few things going for them. Like I said, the first time was pretty good, and if I knew I was guaranteed that every time, I'd have no problems returning.  Megas basically comes down to this: if the place isn't busy, stop in and check it out; if they are busy, keep walking.</text></sentence><sentence id="138"><text>Once upon a time I was a university student.  Without giving you an exact number of how many years it's been, I will tell you that Gap wanted everyone in khakis, pagers weren't quite obsolete, and Mambo #5 was tearing up the charts.  So thankfully a lot has changed, but two things remain, and will always remain the same, about student life.  Number one:  students are broke.  Number two:  they are hungry.  Say Cheese is going to make many U of T students very happy. 

I haven't met a grilled cheese sandwich I didn't like, and I haven't met anyone that doesn't like a grilled cheese sandwich.  That might be why so many gourmet grilled cheese places are popping up these days, but it's a risky business.  The people have spoken and they want grilled cheese sammies...but they don't want to pay a lot for them.  After all, you can make a perfectly good one at home with white bread, and cheese that's more plastic than it is dairy.  And that's where Say Cheese comes in.  Nigel Koo, part owner and operator wants to satisfy stomachs without putting a dent in wallets.  He doesn't see why he can't serve up a high quality sandwich at a low(ish) cost and have customers walking out in a lactose induced ecstasy.

It was quiet when I arrived but word wasn't really out yet, and the boys were still experimenting in their test kitchen.  I was happy to be a guinea pig.  I asked to try their most popular meat and veggie options, and this is what followed.  

I started with Indira's Pulled Pork made with Beemster.  Diners can choose to have regular cheese, such as cheddar, on their sandwich ($6.50) or upgrade to a premium choice ($8.50). My creation came topped with homemade mac &amp; cheese (fun!) on whole wheat bread.  I only ate half as I had more coming my way, but the sandwiches here are generous, and I had to pace myself.  The different textures paired nicely, but I would have liked it more had the meat been a touch saucier, or came with something in which to dip it.

Next, came the Italian Classic.  Not that I'm taking bets, but if you put Buffalo mozzarella on anything, I will eat it.  So I was pleased when they said one of their best meatless sellers was filled with the stuff.  I like a good Margharita pizza, and this was the sandwich version.  

As if that wasn't enough (and by all dietary standards, it was more than that) I was offered their dessert sandwich.  It didn't take a lot of prodding, and went something like this;

 Nigel:  You should try our dessert option. 

 Me:  Wow, I don't know.  I'm really stuffed.  Okay.

The French Grilled Toast is like a m&#233;nage a trois between a grilled cheese, some French toast, and a piece of cheesecake. It's good.  Scary good.  Filled with ricotta, mascarpone and a berry compote, the sandwich is then dusted with turbinado sugar, and drizzled with maple syrup.  As with French toast, this needed to be eaten with a knife and fork, which probably worked in my best interest as it stopped me from inhaling it.  I will be going back for this one.  As it is now, I think about it more than anyone should think about a sandwich.

So in total I ended up eating just a little bit more than a full sandwich thanks to the few bites I had of the French toast, and I was beyond full.  So much so, that I actually skipped dinner that night. Now by my calculations, that equals two meals for the price of one, and a low price at that. This bodes well for hungry students up to their necks in debt.  

Footnote:  During the week, for a mere thirty minutes between 4:20 and 4:50 you can get yourself a sandwich and side (including soup, salad and possible ramen...) for just $4.20.</text></sentence><sentence id="139"><text>As I'm writing this, I already know a lot of people are going to disagree with me. After all, the arrival of littlefish in the Junction has definitely been well received. The neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot. Unfortunately, the arrival of littlefish hasn't completely filled that void just yet. They still have a few kinks to work out, but don't give up on them yet. I won't, but only because I really want to love it.

Ok. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.

The brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.

The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.

The thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.

People rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.

Make no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West, they may not be doing as well as they are now.

So would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.</text></sentence><sentence id="140"><text>I'm a sucker for top-notch pizza. By top-notch, I mean pizza that is served sizzling and fresh and made with high-quality ingredients. Pizza like that is true craftsmanship; pizza like that I could eat every day. In my continuing effort to find superior pizza, I looked to Lil' Baci in Leslieville. My visit didn't disappoint me.

Lil' Baci's dining room is a decent-sized dining space, but the tables are packed pretty tight, so don't expect too much privacy. You'll likely hear everything that the table next to you is talking about. If you need to escape your neighbour table, in the warmer months you may want to check out the cute backyard patio. Comfortable, busy, and social, it's the place to be when the sun is out.

When I'm eating Italian food, I like to start off with a glass of red vino or cold Italian beer. Lil' Baci's wine list is small but thorough and their beer list offers some nice Italian choices; Moretti and Perroni are my personal favourites.

Lil' Baci has a seriously amazing dandelion greens salad.  If you've never had dandelions as food before, this would be the one to expose yourself to it. The greens are slightly bitter, but the bitterness works well topped with shaved Parmigiano, cracked black pepper, and freshly squeezed lemon. Perfect starter.

And the pizza, they do it right. Lil' Baci has a savoury and seasoned tomato sauce base that expertly compliments the four cheeses that are layered on their Quattro Fromagi; my personal favorite.  They've got some other really outstanding pizzas to choose from like the Margherita (with tomato, basil, and mozza), the Lil' Baci (with pecorino, sausage, and fennel pollen), and the Gorgonzola Dolce (with gorgonzola, Yukon gold potatoes, and caramelized onions). All of their pizzas are served on signature thin crust dough that is seared and blistered perfectly.

Lil Baci has got a really small pasta menu. Ridiculously small. There's only three items. But still, these 3 items are done perfectly. They're all made with quality ingredients and use that great tomato sauce that's on the pizza. My favorite is just the plain ole' Spaghetti and meatballs.  It's got just the right amount of fresh basil, sauce, and Parmigiano. The portion size isn't huge, but with that dandelion salad and something from their Insalata menu, it's more than enough.

Lil' Baci also has a Panino menu, which surprisingly is different from their pizza menu. I love the Panino Tonnato. Packed with Italian tuna, caper aioli, sun-dried tomatoes and arugula, it's perfectly pressed into an amazing bite.

The dessert menu has a few options, but when I was there I had a lemon prosecco tart. The crust was buttery, but a tad on the dry side. The custard-like lemon filling had a refreshing prosecco flavour, which balanced the acidity nicely.

I head to Lil' Baci when I want some decently priced Italian food and some amazing pizza. Lunch or dinner, what you end up with is a steal anywhere in the city!</text></sentence><sentence id="141"><text>I was here the other day for lunch and, as expected, there was a bit of a line.  That's usually a good sign, and in this case it's definitely true. But waiting for a table isn't all bad; there's lots to see in this place: kitchy cute decor and lots of memoribilia that reminded me of my childhood. When I was there, the place was cramped and full of hungry people, but everyone was in good spirits. 

When I look at the menu, i always find it difficult to make a choice. They've got a big, diverse menu with both savory and sweet items. All of it looks delicious.  

First off, I'm a vegetarian, but, like to get the breakfast pocket, sans pemeal bacon of course.  It's chock full of fluffy eggs, caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun. Aunties and Uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides, but I've never chose anything but the potato salad. Seriously, this stuff is good. A great combo of chunky red potatoes, dill, Dijon and spices, it's savoury and creamy. Admittedly, my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive, so if you go, don't go when you're in a hurry.

Fruit juices and iced teas are good choices, but I wouldn't finish off with an espresso as they may suggest. Their espresso is nothing special and just plain weak, and it certainly doesn't stand up to Manic coffee located just a few doors down. If you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, I'd suggest you head over to Manic.

Aunties and Uncles loses points in service. The service staff seem a bit cold, sorta aloof, and alot grouchy, but despite if you're willing to overlook that, then this is worth a visit if you're in the College &amp; Bathurst area.</text></sentence><sentence id="142"><text>Meh. You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.

I'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong. 

La Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.

But one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it. 

Perfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.

On this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.

Seriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West. If you're looking for authenticity, you've got a ton of other way-better options in this city.</text></sentence><sentence id="143"><text>The story goes, according to the Murray's Sandwich Emporium website, that Murray is a weiner dog who loves the finer things in life. Despite the obvious assumptions, Murray does not take kindly to eating regular old hot dogs. He prefers a more delectable, refined meal. What does Murray like the most? Sandwiches, of course! In fact, he loves them so much that he  used all of his love and expertise to build a sandwich shop for his fellow sandwich lovers. Thus, Murray's Sandwich Emporium sprang to life.

I recently found myself in the exact same conundrum as Murray the dog was; I was sick of my same-ol'-same-ol' packed lunches, and I was searching for something better. I know you're thinking that sandwiches have to be the most clich&#233; lunch choice of them all, but one look at Murray's menu, and you'll know that you're in for something much different. 

There is not a huge selection (by sheer number) at Murray's, but each item is unique, and there is a decent range of combinations across the board. There are meatless, chicken, beef, fish, cheese and even sweet sandwiches, plus a decent offering of sides (note: combos and sides are extra). 

The restaurant itself is pretty simplistic. It's small, has exposed and undecorated brick walls and two large wooden tables with stools scattered around them. The chalkboard menu hangs on the wall, and there is a small refrigerator full of beverages just off to the side. It is all very subdued and quite appropriate for a sandwich shop.

I held back a bit on my first trip to Murray's. I didn't really know what to expect, how big the servings would be, and what kind of value I would find there. I decided to go with The Uncle Phil: sliced ribeye, onions, green peppers and ooey, gooey, messy, melty provolone cheese on a beautiful baguette. 

Truthfully, I thought the bread was the best part of this sandwich. I don't feel bad for discounting the meat or toppings because, for sandwiches at least, the bread is just as much a star in the meal as anything else. The baguette was clearly very fresh, they keep it tender (but crispy) and most importantly, not over or under-stuffed. The meat was tender too, but it needed a bit more oomph. The green peppers were just slightly saut&#233;ed, giving them a nice crunch and, as mentioned above, the cheese was gloriously gooey. All of that was topped off with a pickle - for nine bucks!

I felt that I didn't really get the whole experience of Murray's my first time around, so on my second visit I decided to get into some side dishes. I certainly didn't hold back on my sandwich choice with The BL-Tizzy - double smoked B, of course some L and T, house-made mayo, avocado and an egg (a $1.00 add-on). I threw all of that into a combo with some onion rings and a can of pop, bringing my total to $12 plus tax. This is a bit pricey in my opinion, but considering the amount of food they give you, it's not so bad. Here again, I thought the bread stood out more than anything else. It was so fresh and tasted of near perfection. Just like The Uncle Phil, the fillings were good but, other than the sheer volume, they were fairly regular...tasty, but regular.

Overall, Murray's Sandwich Emporium offers a delicious product that is definitely over-sized and that will satisfy your hunger. Plus, they're open for lunch, dinner and late-night eats. However, as tasty as the sandwiches are, I can't say anything really blew me away. Yes, the menu item names are unique and fun and the serving sizes are huge, but nothing is really over the top. That being said, sometimes simple is best; they know what they're good at, they know how to make a good sandwich, and they're consistent. 

Good boy, Murray.</text></sentence><sentence id="144"><text>I am in love...

How do I know? I paid $22 for a burger lunch and am absolutely ok with it.

Grindhouse is serious carnivore territory.

The first thing to stand out, though, was my drink. I went for my usual diet cola and I got, "Sorry we don't have anything with aspartame." In fact, you shouldn't go there expecting to get your go-to big brand soft drink at all. Well, well, well I better go for something really interesting then. Boylan's Birch Beer - a root beer drink, sweetened with cane sugar, with pure vanilla extract and only one preservative (sodium benzoate, typically used in soft drinks and other acidic preserves). Their amazing dedication to fresh and natural ingredients obviously did not end there.

All of the ingredients are local and fresh, the burger meat comes from naturally raised livestock and is Genetically Modified Organism, hormone and antibiotic-free. You will not find anything that has refined sugars, or artificial sweeteners (hence the lack of Coca-Cola and Pepsi on the premises). They literally prepare everything in-house. The buns are made there and they also make the ketchup and mustard themselves, right in the back kitchen. The "fresh and never frozen" attitude is not good enough here; if you're going to do it, do it right.

Their burger creations are unique and creative; a turkey burger with black truffles and cranberries, yes they do have a veggie burger and it's soy-free and, my choice, the black and blue burger are just a few of the menu items. I was presented with a Cajun spiced beef patty smothered in blue cheese sauce and cooked only to medium, with a side of onion rings (who was I kidding with that diet cola anyway).

If you can be sure of the meat quality, requesting a burger cooked less than well-done will give you much more flavour and a better texture. On my first bite there was an immediate rush of barbecue charcoal flavour emanating from the patty; it tasted like summertime. The blue cheese sauce was mild and, considering the Cajun description, it was spiced, not spicy. The onion rings were huge and somehow satisfyingly greasy but unbelievably crispy.

I actually don't often talk about presentation because, frankly, it's all about the taste for me. I have eaten enough beautiful yet disappointing and ugly yet amazing dishes to spend much time considering plating. However, the simple beauty of this burger and onion rings dish was lovely - just a white plate and a burger, without a toothpicked-pickle piercing the bun. Lovely.

Much like my University professors, I hesitate to give out a "perfect" score and I can't on good conscious say that this was the very best burger in the city, but - a big but - they gave me something pretty darn close to the best burger around and the attention paid to good, fresh and healthful ingredients truly impressed me.

Their name might be harsh and gory, but you'll find burger-fare inside that is gentle and kind to you and your body.</text></sentence><sentence id="145"><text>If you are on your way to go shopping at Bayview Village, and you need to stop for a quick bite, look no further than Aux Delices Caf&#233;.

Situated at the main entrance of Bayview, now in its third year of business at the mall, and judging by the patrons that came through in our lengthy Saturday afternoon visit, this place is a hit with the locals. Being situated in a bit more of an upscale mall, Aux Delices caters to their clientele. Health conscious foodies will delight in their selection of fresh, gourmet ingredients, including Panini's, pastas, crepes, salads, and even specialties like duck l'orange and homemade gelato, just to name a few. There menu is ever changing, depending on seasonal availability, so there is always something new to try at Aux Delices.

We started our meal with the fresh manicotti and roasted mushroom caps, duck l'orange with mushroom and greens, and roasted eggplant salad. Everything tasted like fresh, home cooking. The manicotti ($6.50) was amazing, with melt-in-your-mouth ricotta, and ripe tomatoes that tasted like they were picked form the garden that morning. The stuffed Portobello mushroom cap with cheese and polenta was an awesome side dish, complementing the Italian flavours in the manicotti, but would be great as an entr&#233;e on its own.

The duck l'orange was cooked perfectly, tender and succulent, the sauce was sweet and tangy, and the accompanying side salads of oyster mushrooms and greens, and roasted eggplant were in a league of their own. I would have returned just to try a sampling of all their fresh veggie salads.

Next up, a roasted vegetable Panini, recommended by our host. The yellow pepper, red onion and eggplant were soft and easy to eat, with a nice portion of goat cheese on lovely focaccia bread. Moving into crepe territory, we decided to tackle the ham and cheese crepe ($9.50), with tomatoes as well, and would go back for more. Their crepes are light and fluffy, and packed with ingredients. Even better, your crepe is made right in front of you, and you can add any ingredients you like. A fun experience for kids, too.

For those looking for the "caf&#233;" experience, they serve up delightful illy coffee, and Rahier desserts, that almost make you feel like you are dining in Europe. Their double espressos were great, nice and bold, and the latte was perfect, frothy and steamed to perfection. The homemade gelato was amazing. I love ice cream, and have been a latecomer to the gelato trend, but I am glad that I tried it. We sampled the chocolate, vanilla and pistachio, a must when having gelato, and they were all very well done. The vanilla and chocolate especially, both true to their flavours, with a natural, nuttier taste, rather than overtly sweet.

Aux Delices Caf&#233; offers a fabulous dining experience, and allows you to stop in for a fast and easy meal, or linger over a cup of coffee and a pastry. All of their meals are available to go, making it a great option to stop in after work for a ready-made meal.
Gourmet meals ready as soon as you order, great coffee and homemade gelato should have you stopping for a break on your next shopping trip.</text></sentence><sentence id="146"><text>Cupcakes have reached a point of utmost popularity in the world of baked goods. Why are people flocking to these brightly coloured, frosted, palm-sized desserts? Well, I'm sure there is some greater social commentary to be made here about a reversion to childhood or a need for comfort foods in our over-stressed, over-worked lives, but, in the case of Prairie Girl Bakery, it's just simply that they taste so darn good!

Walking into Prairie Girl Bakery is almost like entering a fine clothing store - everything is placed just so. The whole space is pristinely clean and clear of clutter; literally nothing exists except a counter and back-wall display. The cupcakes are kept safely behind the employees, lined up row by row waiting to be selected and boxed up. All of the focus is on their one and only product. There is no time wasted on brewing coffee, serving tea, or making sandwiches. Everything comes down to one thing: the cake and the icing.

When I first walked into the store, I thought I made a mistake. I went in to grab a dozen cupcakes for a work function and was shocked at the lack of merchandise on the shelves. I had to ask, "was I supposed to pre-order before coming in?" Not at all. They just take extra care to provide the freshest product possible, promising never to serve a "day-old cupcake." So, baking in big batches to keep the shelves stocked to the brim all day is out of the question. The team at Prairie Girl Bakery prides itself on being resourceful and limiting waste; they even take any leftover cupcakes to a local charitable organization, Toronto's Second Harvest, that is dedicated to providing realistic solutions to hunger. Are cupcakes a necessity for a charitable food organization? Of course not, but why not give where you can and provide something a bit more luxurious than canned food to those in need.

The cupcakes come in two sizes, 13 flavours, and an array of beautiful colours. You won't find any unneeded extras here, like (in)edible sugar flower toppings disguising an otherwise delectable treat. The cakes are simple and the swirls of icing are in the spotlight on top of light bases. The range of flavours include peanut butter banana, red velvet with classic cream cheese icing, chocolate-chocolate, chocolate-vanilla, chocolate-hazelnut, chocolate cake with peppermint icing, and my ultimate favourite, chocolate cake with strawberry icing. The strawberry colour was fairly mute, but the flavour was intense. Even more impressive was that the chocolate cake didn't overpower the icing or vice versa. Each deep flavour perfectly complemented the other.

A dozen mini-cupcakes come in at $18.95 and one dozen regular size at $31.95. My gluttonous side will only order the mini cupcakes from now on, allowing me to eat two or three different flavours in one sitting. However, there is something supremely gorgeous about the sight of one of their regular sized cupcakes sitting in it's very own container (complete with viewing window) waiting only for you.

Want to feel a little less guilty about completely indulging in these sinfully tasty treats? Prairie Girl Bakery's dedication to remaining as all-natural as possible streams throughout the whole operation. Not only do they use recyclable cardboard packaging, but they are absolutely free of preservatives, artificial flavours, and hydrogenated or "trans" fats. I'd say that's mostly healthy eating.

On one final note, I have to say that I love the mythology around this place. The story is that Prairie Girl Bakery's creator, Jean Blacklock, learned all she knew from her family back on her Saskatchewan farm. She eventually left a career in law to bring that down home prairie, old fashioned baking to us city-dwellers. I don't think there could possibly be more charm or more beauty in the simplicity of what Prairie Girl Bakery is and what they produce.</text></sentence><sentence id="147"><text>Coquine Restaurant serves up an excellent weekend brunch, with all the charm and flavour of a European patio caf&#233;. The restaurant is decked out art-deco style, with lots of white tile, dark wood and vintage posters lining the walls. Coquine boasts several large dining rooms and a quaint patio, perfect for people watching or a leisurely meal. A large group of us descended on Coquine one Sunday morning for a late brunch, and found the menu to be both classic and eclectic. Let me explain. .

Traditional Sunday morning brunch normally sees a line-up of the usuals; pancakes, omelets and waffles. While Coquine serves up all of these items, they do it all with a pronounced French flavour, not afraid of adding a little gourmet to your breakfast.  Coquine's wonderful Apple Jack's ($11) offers up a stack of fluffy pancakes, topped with delectable caramelized apple and maple syrup. The delightful Vanilla French Toast ($12) is flavoured with fresh vanilla bean and served with a berry compote and Chambord. The Steak Frites ($19) were delicious, and came with a side of Parmesan truffle fries and mayo. While you may not be able to fly to Paris for weekend brunch, you can certainly enjoy the savoury French-style cuisine just south of Yonge and Eglinton.

Everyone found their meals to be excellent, and I can personally attest to both the quality and quantity of the wild mushroom and shallot Quiche with ch&#233;vre ($14). Coffee (and Bailey's) was always available, and attentive extras like water for the group, and non-stop breadbaskets make the service at Coquine both pleasant and under-stated.

Overall, the value for meals was very good, as portions were large, and fit for sharing. Both the hostess and the server were polite and attentive, but never obvious. With an excellent location between Davisville and Eglinton subway stops, and great food and service, Coquine should be on your list as a must-try for weekend brunch.</text></sentence><sentence id="148"><text>If the word 'bulk' conjers up images of dusty old ethnic shop food bins or soulless Bulk Barns, then you need to check out Nuthouse for a second opinion. Sitting in a little space out in the Bloor and Lansdowne, Nuthouse has established itself with Blansdowne locals as the best place around to pick up all sorts of interesting products.

First thing you'll notice about Nuthouse is that it smells good...it smells really good...it smells like an incredibly nice mix of high-quality nuts, cereals, grains, teas, dried fruit, lentils, dried fruit, spices, cake, and coffee. It's a smell that right away makes you feel comfortable and assures you that what you're getting is filled with quality. Don't expect to see the typical bulk fare with hundreds of bins full of overly processed and mass-produced stuff; you're in the wrong place for that sorta thing. Nuthouse is full of nothing but always high quality and sometimes organic products.

Ok. That might not be the very first thing you notice. Chances are, if you're walking down Bloor looking for this place, or even if you're not looking for it, the first thing you'll notice won't even be inside the store; it'll be the big, plastic walnut hanging above the front doorway. That big walnut has become somewhat of a landmark item on this stretch of Bloor, even though they've only been in business for a few months.

Nuthouse isn't just about nuts. They carry all sorts of things, from organic candy and fair-trade coffee to raw cereals and handmade soap. And its healthy too. A lot of the stuff they carry is the sugar-free, vegan, raw, organic type of stuff, which makes it a super option for more health conscious people. And if you have dietary restrictions, Nuthouse has got you covered too with tons of gluten and wheat free products, like their spiced carrot cake. If that's your bag and you live in the area, you no longer need to travel far to get these kinda things.

Personally, when I think of organic or locally-sourced or handmade or any other related adjective used to describe stuff in a store like this, I unfortunately also think 'expensive'. At Nuthouse though, that really isn't the case. The prices are actually fairly down-to-earth and mostly afforable. In fact, a lot of the products they sell are actually cheaper than the bulk stuff you find at No Frills, with an obvious element of quality you may not find at bigger places. 

Wanting to try out interesting varieties of stuff you already love, like lentils or rice or yes, even nuts? Nuthouse has got you covered. They carry a ton of different kinds, some of which you probably didn't even know existed. And that brings up one of the best things about buying in bulk in a place like this: you can buy in smaller amounts purely just because you want to try something. Buying in bulk doesn't have to be about being able to get more for less, it's about being able to also get, well, just less. The fact that Nuthouse just happens to make it also affordable is just the icing on the organic carrot cake.</text></sentence><sentence id="149"><text>Walk in to Famoso's new Annex location and there is no mistaking the kind of restaurant you have entered: a popular, loud hang out for students, families and friends alike. It's a casual place with daily deals (movies, cheap wine on Wednesdays, etc.), TVs showing Blue Jays' games and young staff working feverishly to keep up with the sit-in and take-out clientele.  It's got a pleasant, relaxed vibe and people seemed to be rather enjoying themselves.

Once seated in our booth, we perused the menu and our lovely server explained how the restaurant works: you write down your order on the notepad provided, bring it up to the counter and hand it in. You can either pay right away or begin a tab. Any subsequent orders can be placed through the wait staff. I assume this method is effective for those in a hurry, but it did seem a little odd considering how often our server checked in on us. She also expounded upon the "red sauce" pizzas made with Campania tomato sauce, fior-de-latte mozzarella, basil and pecorino romano cheese. (The "white sauce"pizzas are made with a garlic and olive oil sauce instead of the tomatoes.)

We opted for the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls for an appetizer, the funghi tartufo and San Andreas pizzas and, for dessert, the dolce and banana dish. As with any self-respecting pizza place, they had San Pellegrino on the menu so got an Aranciata (my fave) and a Limonata. My dining companion kindly took the order the counter while I scoped out the huge place before me. Famoso has really nice exposed brick walls, comfortable booths and, by my count, at least three staff members per table. There are a lot of eyes on tables and not much gets missed. The staff is universally nice, if perhaps inexperienced. It lacked a certain finesse, but made up for it in sweet charm.

Our appetizer arrived and I'm glad we asked for salt, pepper and chili flakes. The mozzarella balls were tasty, but the red sauce (which would appear later on our funghi pizza) was very, very sweet. For my liking, too sweet.  A dash of salt and some chili flakes were necessary and helped considerably. I was hoping for crispier prosciutto, too; as a start to the meal, it was pretty average. If you're going to get an appetizer, I would recommend you try a salad. They looked fresh and tasty.

Our funghi  tartufo pizza arrived fairly shortly afterward. It consisted of roasted white mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, truffle oil and parmiggiano reggiano.  Again, it was better with the salt and chili flakes.  The crusts at Famoso are a bit thicker than is the trend right now, but I liked the chewier texture. I only wish that this pizza had been left in the 900-degree oven a little longer as it needed a little more crispiness to counter the soft, melting cheese that was starting to soak through the crust. (A note: I took a slice of this one home and had it two days later. I have to say, it tasted much better as a leftover!)

Our second pizza - the San Andreas - was a "New World Pizza" with a white sauce, chili-lime marinated chicken and fresh mozzarella. It was then baked and topped with avocado slices, diced roma tomatoes, onion, cilantro, a drizzle of cream and a lime wedge. Certainly not traditional, but pretty darned tasty. The pizza seemed to have stayed in the oven just that little bit longer and had that nice char on the bottom. The lime juice provided a bright flavour and the chicken was tender. (I'd have liked a little more chicken, but that's a bit of a nitpick. It was a good pizza.) Were I to go back, I would steer my companions toward it if they wanted to try something a little different.

Finally, dessert. This was my favourite dish of the four we tried. A long, rectangular plate of roasted bananas coated in caramelized brown sugar, topped with pecans and caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream in the middle arrived at the table and my eyes widened. This looked and smelled fantasti and tasted even better. The bananas were piping hot and creamy and contrasted beautifully with the crunch of the sugar and the chill of the ice cream. That dish was devoured in what had to be record time.

Overall, Famoso is...fine. There isn`t anything in particular that stands out but there isn't anything egregiously wrong with it, either.  It caters to a wide variety of tastes so it is sure to be a good option if you are going out with a group with varying tastes or dietary restrictions or preferences. Do not bother with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls, but do not skip dessert.</text></sentence><sentence id="150"><text>La Passione is a dimly lit and intimately decorated restaurant on Yonge, just south of St. Clair, where you can get your fill of any and all your Italian favourites and a (huge) glass of wine.
Their extensive menu holds everything from Calamari Fritti, Insalata Arugula, Papparedelle al Salmone and Penna alla Vodka to Gnocchi with a choice of four sauces, Pollo alla Jolly (chicken in rose sauce) and Margherita pizza (a simple delight of mozzarella, olive oil and oregano).

La Passione balances the traditional with some modern comforts; you can peruse the thorough and interactive website and check out their Facebook page, then go and grab a classic white-clothed, candle-lit table and dip your focaccia in olive oil and balsamic before ordering gluten-free or whole wheat pasta.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting and, as I found out while waiting for my dinner guests who were running late, it is a very comfortable space to sit and relax with a glass of red.

From start to finish, it was delightful. For such a moderately-priced Italian restaurant, they surely hold their own.

I was ecstatic to find that my penne side dish with the Pollo alla Fiorentina - chicken saut&#233;ed with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes in smooth and rich cream sauce - could be replaced with tender gnocchi. I truly could eat pasta every day, but gnocchi is my new favourite indulgence. I'm on the hunt for the best in the city and will devour any potato pasta nugget that comes my way in the process.

The veal Marsala entree is adorned with tons of saut&#233;ed mushrooms, the vegetables were cut large and almost put the roasted potatoes to shame; it was true Italian comfort food.
And as for the Papparedelle al Salmone, the wide threads of pasta are covered all over with a pink Salmon-infused cream sauce. Rich and smooth, this was definitely the star of our table.

Personally, I can't go to an Italian restaurant that has Tartufo on the menu and not order it - no matter how full dinner has left me. A few flavours are offered, but I finally landed on Tartufo Royale, a tart and sweet pairing of raspberry and chocolate ice creams covered in cocoa and drizzled with chocolate sauce. I also happened to snag a scoop of pistachio gelato, but it didn't hold a candle to the aforementioned chocolate indulgence.

La Passione was a nice surprise, with entrees coming in around $15-$20 and a wide-range of choices on the menu, it is sure to satisfy. They also occasionally post deals on Groupon - it makes for the perfect opportunity to get out and try something new.</text></sentence><sentence id="151"><text>La Revolucion is amazing! Well no, it isn't, but that's exactly how I wanted to start this off. Man, I really wanted to love this place. La Revolucion just looks so dam cool, that I figured the whole experience was going to be amazing. When I was first drawn by the interesting front stained-glass window and poked my head inside to look around, I figured that in no-time-at-all, there'd be a lineup to get in. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be the case anytime soon.

La Revolucion is a Mexican restaurant, but at first glance, it certainly doesn't scream Mexican; after eating there, I'm not even sure that's what they're going for. It's a sparsely decorated joint that for some reason--at least while I was there--feels the need to distance themselves even more from their Mexican roots by blasting annoyingly loud rave music. I mean, their food is the typical, standard Mexican fare you'd expect, like enchiladas and tacos and burritos, but other than that and the few Mexican-esque decorations, there wasn't much Mexican about it at all.

They're heavily pushing the banditos aspect of Mexican culture, which is actually a pretty cool gimic in my eyes. While I get the whole concept of banditos and revolution, it seemed as though La Revolucion fell a little short of their delivery of the theme. While what little decor they have there is mostly bandito-related, the rest of the theme is left to interpretation. La Revolucion does feel as though they're finding their identity, but they have a lot of difficulty conveying what that identity is exactly to their guests. Sitting there, it doesn't feel as though you were part of the revolution, it feels as though you're interrupting them while they plan it, and they can't wait for you to leave so they can get back down to business.

Presentation isn't their strong point either. They haphazardly slap the food down on the plate, without much concern for appearances. My enchiladas were slightly warm and covered in tasteless green salsa; my burrito was humungous, but it was bland and not nearly warm enough. When I asked for hot sauce, because it was nowhere to be found, I got a small ramekin with some sort of sauce, but it's details remained a mystery that was left for me to find out with no explanation from the server, and while you're waiting for that stuff to all arrive, there's no offer of chips and salsa or even water for that matter, which would have definitely improved the experience.

Interestingly enough, before this place was a Mexican place it was, well, a Mexican place. Whoever it is that owns it probably just decided it was time to rebrand, and while that may have been a great idea on their part, the execution of their new brand and concept needs some polishing because it's hard to tell exactly what the concept is. La Revolucion may be a restaurant, but a revolution it is not.</text></sentence><sentence id="152"><text>The Rotisserie House is a family-run, Portuguese barbeque (or Churrasqueira) restaurant in the Liberty Village area. Like most places owned and run by families, this restaurant is small, a bit cluttered with a mishmash of d&#233;cor and, no matter the number of other patrons there at the time, has a staff that makes you feel like the centre of attention.

They happen to be closed on the weekend, but from Monday to Thursday they are open from 11:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Fridays from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. The hours are slightly odd, but it makes for a great lunch spot, especially for those like me who tend to take lunch anytime between about noon and 3:00 p.m.

They offer a variety of chicken dishes, a number of different sides and even one vegetarian option. You can get a 1/4 or 1/2 rotisserie chicken dinner - white meat or dark meat - with a choice of two small sides for $6.50 - $10.00. For an additional $0.99 (small) or $1.98 (double) you can get a side of onion rings, Greek or Caesar salad.

The menu itself is pretty huge and is filled with quite a few options. The regular roster of sides, for example, includes Portuguese rice, roasted Parisian potatoes, steamed vegetables, French fries, garden salad or potato wedges. Mains include the abovementioned chicken combos, rib combos, a variety of salads and soups, chicken wings and fingers and sandwiches, like pulled chicken, grilled vegetable, grilled chicken, pork or sausage. They even offer catering.

I decided upon the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of Parisian potatoes. The pulled chicken is topped with their "famous" hot sauce, served on a white or whole wheat Kaiser and is dressed with mayo, lettuce and tomato. All of this, with a drink, came in at about $9.

One of my all-time favourite side dishes are those lemony, roasted potatoes available at most Greek restaurants. Well, The Rotisserie House's Parisian roasted potatoes are a close second. They are red, probably from Paprika, and just a bit fiery from the restaurant's signature hot sauce. The pulled chicken sandwich was flavourful, tender and also had the same red hue from the sauce.

I do enjoy spicy foods, though I am a bit of a wimp. This restaurant's hot sauce had a great kick and a good flavour, but it won't burn your mouth to the point that you can't taste anything else. This is really important, since they throw the hot sauce on their dishes, whether it's requested or not. Don't fret too much about all the spice if you're grabbing lunch and heading back to the office, you can buy a pack of gum here too!

Considering the size of this restaurant, I was quite surprised by the number of items they have on the menu. It was not overly busy when I walked in, so everything went very smoothly as far as timing and service went. The staff is extremely friendly, but very small, so I am curious to see what happens when it gets really busy. However, they seem to have it all figured out.

If I lived closer to Liberty Village, I could see this being a regular staple for me for a quick lunch, or to grab some dinner on the way home from work. The prices are reasonable, the food tastes good and it's quick and satisfying.</text></sentence><sentence id="153"><text>The most common praise of Dark Horse is its patio; the most common complaint about Dark Horse is its lack of service on the patio...

If you've been to Bloor West Village, you know that there aren't a lot of patios in the neighbourhood, and any patio that you do find is likely going to be small, cramped, and full of people. With the exception of the Firkin on Runnymede, Dark Horse has one of the biggest and best outdoor spaces in the village to drink pints, people watch or eat burgers and fries.

But, as many people have pointed out before me, the service can range anywhere from slow to crappy when you're sitting out there. While you're waiting, you may even be waiting so long for service that you'll feel compelled to go inside and get your own drinks, which causes the server to give you attitude when she eventually gets to your table, which causes you to feel uncomfortable; you see the vicious circle taking shape here...

All-in-all, the food at Dark Horse isn't half bad. Granted, they aren't going to win any awards anytime soon, but for pub food that goes well with a few drinks, it's pretty decent. While some of the food, like the calamari and nachos, is previously frozen and highly unimaginative, other items, like their Village Burger or fish and chips, are clearly made in-house and truly tasty. They also serve a weekend brunch that is worth checking out, but expect to wait for a table; it fills up quickly with the neighbourhood locals.

All of the expected draft options are here...I think. Truth-be-told, the server never actually rattled off the draft list to us in the limited time she spent at our table. Luckily, there were a few beer-branded signs in the patio, which makes the process a little easier, but a lot less convenient.

Dark Horse's problems are easily fixable; they just need a bit more staff. Trust me, sit back on the patio, have a pint, and watch them work. It'll quickly become obvious that they're understaffed. Another server or two during their busier times, and Dark Horse could be fantastic.

Truth be told, it's just a pub, and a fairly average one at that. If you're in a hurry, you may want to avoid this place, but if you've got some time to kill and want to soak up some sun on a patio, Dark Horse provides nicely.</text></sentence><sentence id="154"><text>Located in the Annex, in the middle of Mirvish Village, The Central is a bar, a restaurant, and a live music venue.  The dimly lit house-turned-restaurant with the splendidly seamy vibe immediately and completely tugged at my heart strings.  I loved the rickety setting and little details like the "Draught: Use Your Eyes" sign behind the bar.

But, as with any new love, first impressions can often deceive you; The Central played with my emotions.  The menu - and be warned the online menu is not what you will find when you arrive there - has so much potential and I very much wanted the food to live up to my expectations.  My party of three shared grilled calamari with side of salad greens in a light citrus dressing, followed by entrees of grilled mushroom salad with shrimp, a grilled vegetable sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a cheesesteak sandwich with Tom Yum soup, all of which (with three beers) came in at just over $60.

The menu items are not very risky, but still need to be done carefully to be successful.  As much as I wanted everything to come out perfectly, it simply did not.  First of all, the calamari was a very large serving - so far, so good.  But, in grilling it whole, the tips became overcooked and the centre remained undercooked, and there was a hint of burnt charcoal flavour.  The grilled vegetables were also overcooked, producing an all-over brown hue, making them completely lose their individuality.  The cheesesteak had the right flavour, but again, the beef was slightly overcooked and chewy.  Finally, after looking forward to trying one of the desserts in hopes for menu-redemption, like the candied strawberries or the ever-infamous deep fried Mars bars, we were told that all they had available was ice cream.  Not so impressive.

While the main dishes and lack of desserts were disappointing, I do have to commend them on a couple of things.  All of the side dishes were on-point; the dressing on both the calamari dish, and the mushroom salad were light, flavourful and had a good citrus tang; the sweet potato fries were crispy, and came with a side of a creamy cinnamon dip that was a great alternative to regular ketchup; and the Tom Yum soup was hot, spicy, and a great choice for a chilly December night.

I have decided that The Central could very well become a favourite spot of mine for drinks, and maybe appetizers, but is just not an ideal choice for a full dinner.  The venue itself is one that you should check out, and I expect it is only better when the patio is open in the summer.  If you don't want to sit in the main bar to listen to the band they have a cozy lounge space upstairs that can be rented for private parties.  Also, they clearly take pride in the beverage menu, especially the beer choices.  When we had some trouble deciding on a pint, we were offered a sample of a new label on tap called Netherworld, a Flying Monkey brew, which is similar to the popular Mill St. Tankhouse Ale.

I give them an A+ for atmosphere, but only a gold star-for-effort on the menu.</text></sentence><sentence id="155"><text>Wanting to try something new, and looking for a cool place to go for pre-Yuk-Yuks dinner and drinks, my friend and I decided to try out Everest Restaurant on Queen West.

What seemed to be a quiet Saturday evening when we first arrived at 7pm, quickly turned into a fairly busy "club" like dining experience. And Everest is certainly dressed to impress. The restaurant feels both sexy and modern, with dark mood lighting, clean lines, comfortable and cozy booth seating, and an eclectic playlist/DJ, depending on what night you are in. With a great view of Queen West for people watching, and MuchMusic across the street, the atmosphere, music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the locals.

I was very excited to try a new place with an interesting food theme, something a little different from the usual weekend dinner and drinks, and hoping to find a new "go-to" place for a fun and creative meal. I secured reservations before our arrival, however, we were greeted with a bit of a frosty reception, waved to an area in the front of the room, and told I could sit wherever I wanted. Unorthodox, maybe, but sit we did!
Putting the hostesses' indifference behind us, we decided to delve straight into the wine menu, and with a little help from our server, selected the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Knights Valley, a California vintage from 2009 for about $40. The wine was excellent, and I found the wine menu to be well priced for the quality of wines on the list.

The dinner menu ($15-$20) presents a somewhat more challenging predicament. Filled with Tibetan and Indian dishes, along side the same old North American stand-by of pasta and sandwiches, I found myself unsure if this was a Tibetan restaurant, or your average Italian eatery all dressed up. It's not that I mind an eclectic menu, in fact I appreciate one, however when venturing out to try a new type of cuisine (in this case, Tibetan), one wants to be sure that the restaurant is absolutely committed to their craft, and have their "specialty cuisine" down pat. Thus, I was unsure of whether venturing into the momas (Tibetan dumplings) and sha-momo (spinach and beef), or the fettuccine alfredo was the better option.

After some quality deliberation between the Tibet/North America paradox, I decided to try a platter, a mix of several different Tibetan style foods, to allow myself to experience as much of the cuisine as possible. The menu seemed heavy on potatoes, stewed meats and rice, so I decided to try almost all of the above. The stewed potatoes were good, cooked just right, but tasted much like something I could make at home, no real special spice or flavour that made me feel like I was trying something exotic. The rice was cooked with raisins, which just didn't do it for me, and was a little bland.  My meal was served with steamed Tibetan vegetables (broccoli and carrots), which aside from not seeming exceptionally Tibetan to me, were surprisingly good. An interesting side note, both of our meals were served with naan bread, which really was just pita bread from my estimation. Overall, I was fairly underwhelmed by my choice. My friend ordered the butter chicken on rice with naan bread (same problem), and said that she enjoyed her meal. The butter chicken looked and tasted pretty standard to me, so that must be a good thing, but neither of us could really wrap our heads around the lack on naan bread at restaurant serving Indian food. 

While I thoroughly enjoyed Everest restaurant for its attention to the design d&#233;cor and ambience, I was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into Tibetan food. I think the next time we decide to go out for Tibetan style cuisine, we will try "Little Tibet" further down Queen Street.</text></sentence><sentence id="156"><text>Despite it's seemingly religious name, this Blansdowne cafe has nothing to do religion. It's a little cafe chock-full of character and a cool, homey-sorta vibe. You know the type of place I'm talking about: mismatched plates and cutlery on the tables, Value Village-esque paintings and pictures on the walls, slightly damaged panelling on the ceiling. It sorta looks like one day someone decided: 'Well, we have a stove. Why don't we open a restaurant?' It seems random, but truthfully, it doesn't matter all that much. If anything, those details make it better and much more comfortable.

There really isn't that much for food here. They've got a couple of items that are fairly easy for the lone person working to make when the place gets busy, which it definitely does. Mostly it's just the standard pressed sandwich kind of thing. No soup, no fries, no salad, as a side anyways. The friendly guy working there told me that it's not that kinda place. He said that it's mostly a cafe and a place to drink booze.

The menu is up on a chalkboard, and like I mentioned, it mostly has pressed sandwiches, like grilled cheese with apples and Tandoori chicken stuffed Naan bread. The sandwiches certainly aren't bad, but sadly, the majority of the stuff they make seems to have been brought in with little of it made in-house, like the Naan bread. The Naan was the kinda stuff pressed and packaged somewhere distant, and then bought at some grocery retail giant. It definitely would have been better if they worked with someone local to get some truly authentic stuff. They do have quite a few baked goods too. I'm not sure if those were made in-house or not, but they look nice next to a cup of the great coffee they serve.

I've seen some pictures of brunch items at Holy Oak, like eggs Benny, but based on when I was there I couldn't see that happening. Maybe they do bring someone in on the weekends to cook, but they guy working never mentioned it to me when I asked him about the food or the limited menu.

I went during the week for lunch, and this little place was pretty packed. Mostly with twenty and thirty somethings in front of laptops. It seems like a pretty cool place to work for those of us that frequent coffee shops for that sorta thing, because there really isn't much else in the neighborhood that offers it. It's cozy and comfortable, and I could easily see myself sitting there with a coffee, comfortably typing away.

Holy Cafe is a neat place, but it certainly doesn't warrant a big trip to get to it. If you happen to be in the neighborhood and you're looking for a comfortable place to soak up WiFi and get a decent cup of coffee, Holy Oak can definitely provide. But it doesn't offer much more than that.</text></sentence><sentence id="157"><text>Sharkey's is no more! And thank God for that. I mean, I know the restaurant options in Bloor West Village are limited, but I really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did. With horrible service, brutal food, and staff that spent more time admiring themselves in the mirror than their customers, they created a place that was meant to be avoided. Yet somehow, it managed to exist on that corner for years.

So, imagine my surprise when I saw the beautiful sight of a building permit and brown construction paper covering their windows one day...

A few months later, The Kennedy Public House was born. And boy-oh-boy, this place is exactly what  BWV needs. BWV is virtually void of restaurants serving great food. Ok, so there's earth and Dr. Generosity, but other than that, your choices are pretty limited compared to the tons of options available to other Toronto neighbourhoods. That's why seeing something as untraditional in BWV as The Kennedy is such a welcoming sight.

The Kennedy has a cool vibe that, if you know the neighbourhood, you wouldn't expect to see there. It seems oddly out-of-place while at the same time seems oddly comfortable being there. With a laboriously nice interior space, the entire design is well-thought out a nice to be in. But surprisingly, The Kennedy isn't just nice to look at; it also has exceptionally good food.

The Kennedy's menu doesn't serve your typical pub grub; it's much more imaginative than that. Non-traditional items, like polenta burgers, calamari po'boy sandwiches, and pork belly casoulet easily compliment more traditional pub fare, like wings, macaroni and cheese, and thin crust pizzas. Their menu does a fantastic job of covering everyone while still remaining concise and well-thought out.
Working with a number of local businesses, the Kennedy also proudly sources bread and meats from places you're probably familiar with, like Cobs bread and Wellington County Beef. Nice. I've always found that knowing where the food comes from somehow makes it taste better.

One other thing worth mentioning: The Kennedy has unisex bathrooms. And they've incorporated them into the place really nicely, except for the hand-dryer. The bathroom hand-dryer must be the loudest dam one in the entire free-world. If you happen to be sitting in the back-half of the restaurant, it might even ruin your experience. Hopefully they'll turn to either cloth or paper towels, or they'll just find one that is quieter.

Keep in mind though, if you're looking for a relaxing experience, this isn't the place. With strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a Montesorri school, and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at John and Adelaide, The Kennedy doesn't provide a quite and relaxing experience; what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldn't expect to find in a typical public house.</text></sentence><sentence id="158"><text>As a group of new Toronto recruits, we decided to try out Rebel House at the suggestion of one of my coworkers. An easy walk from the Rosedale subway stop, we went the evening of the Stanley Cup final, expecting the place to be packed, but managed to find comfortable high-top seating, and friendly service, amidst a fairly busy night.

The Rebel House is a small pub, with a quaint upstairs section, where we sat. Several TV's aired the hockey game, and there was an eclectic mix of people, some older, into their 50's, but predominantly a mix of twenty and thirtysomething young professionals and students.

The menu is varied, but small, although they offer a revolving door of several daily specials that seem to be based on season and availability, which is always a good bet.

My dining partner decided to go with the daily special Mussels ($14), absolutely delicious in a white wine and garlic sauce, with toasted garlic bread. I ordered the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies ($10), small appetizer-sized cheese patties, with nary a spinach leaf in sight...nor were they spicey. No matter. These delightful little morsels were crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and came with a delectable tomato chutney and sour cream to top with. At our server's suggestions, I also ordered the Spinach and Apple Salad ($6), with cheddar cheese, toasted almonds, and a homemade maple dressing on the side. A wonderful combination. In fact, we liked the cheese pennies so much, we ordered another batch, only to find that that a repeat order isn't always as good the second time around. These pennies were so thick with grease, I found myself soaking up the oil slick with a napkin just to get them down. I think ordering a third time might have settled this dilemma for good, but for now I choose to remember the experience based on my initial encounter with the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies; delightful.

My dining partner, an "adventurous" drinker himself, ordered a Labatt Blue, but it did come in the extra large bottle, which made him smile from ear to ear. I ordered the Henry of Pelham Pinot Noir to start, but must admit that it tasted watered down and a bit weak. Not to be discouraged, I tried the 2006 Cabernet Franc Special Reserve VQA after dinner, and was pleasantly surprised by one of the nicer glasses of wine I have had at a pub in some time. It had a heavy quality, with a nice vanilla finish. I would go back to Rebel House just to try this glass of wine again.

Our server was friendly and talkative, and the prices at Rebel House are fairly reasonable. Wine was about $7-$8 a glass, and our meals were between $8-$12 for the appetizers, and up to $20 for an entr&#233;e. Except for the bad experience with the second order of cheese pennies, Rebel House is an excellent neighbourhood pub, serving up good food at good prices.</text></sentence><sentence id="159"><text>I came to Ultimate Caf&#233; by accident. In a desperate attempt to finally darken the doorway of Hey Lucy, I was disheartened to find that going right after work is not nearly early enough to snag a table for cheap martini Wednesday at that popular King West spot. Enter stage-right, Ultimate Caf&#233; (a bit of Entertainment District fun for you there). Whether coincidentally or strategically, they also offer their own cheap martini Wednesday - how clever. 

Their menu is fairly standard, including soups, nachos, sandwiches and Paninis, pastas and salads and they say the ingredients are bought fresh daily from Kensington Market.

After my first meal, I decided to do some reading and collect the thoughts from others before making my final decision on Ultimate. The reviews are mixed, and I have to agree with that sentiment.

I've now been to Ultimate twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. The night of the martinis, I decided to make a meal of appetizers - a favourite thing to do. I had the spring rolls and the sweet potato and lemongrass soup. I wasn't disappointed in the least; the spring rolls were crunchy and hot and the soup, though a tad too sweet for my own taste (always a risk for sweet potato dishes), was flavourful, thick and rich. It was a satisfying meal but, much like the menu, was basic stuff.

Then, I went back for lunch. 

We started with the nachos which turned out to be a delight. They look completely unimpressive, but once you dive in you'll realize that there is just the right amount of melted cheese, neither scorched or soggy, and it's topped lightly with chopped lettuce, tomato, olives and jalapeno. I have come across some online grumbles about the portion sizes, but any more and it would have proven far too big for a two-person starter or a one-person meal. My entr&#233;e was the Montreal smoked meat Panini with a side salad. The Panini was my favourite dish there by far. The meat was warm and tender and, again, was not over-sized. The sandwich was obviously freshly pressed and there was a tangy mustard spread topping it off. But, here's the rub - the salad was small and the leaves were wilted, which is a common complaint across the boards about their greens and the dressing could not possibly have been made in-house. It maybe could have passed for garnish. A really top-notch side could have elevated this dish to be lunch-time excellence. Like the portions, the prices are decent, with both of my visits coming in at just around $20 per person

There is one very short footnote-type comment that I must leave you with. On both occasions I was greeted by an employee whom I can only assume is the host. He will nab you on the street when you stop to glance at the menu to convince you to come in and, though he means well, will be extremely present during your time there. I can't say it was bothersome enough to warrant a phone call, but I also cannot give you my recommendation without mentioning this very obvious addition to the dining experience at Ultimate. 

So, I toyed with a 2-star vs. my decided upon 3-star rating. The decor is kind of cool, the service was fast and courteous, despite the over-attentive host and we were seated in no time on a busy night. They offer some pretty good, if not somewhat lack-lustre grub, with at least one amazing sandwich. 

Just doors down from the previously reviewed Joe Mamas, King West is turning out to be a favourite food stop for me.</text></sentence><sentence id="160"><text>The Duke of Kent serves up traditional pub food in a cozy spot at the corner of Yonge and Eglinton.  Kent is just one of a series of 'Duke Pubs' scattered around Toronto, and judging from the fairly comprehensive website, each has a slightly different d&#233;cor, but all of them seem to tap into that English corner pub ambience.

After a long week at work, I was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint, enjoy some hearty food, and catch up with some friends; the Duke of Kent was a great choice...for the most part.

I snagged a corner booth with my dinner group on a busy Friday night.  When we first walked in, it seemed hopeless. We wanted dinner, but there was nary a table to be seen.  The staff did everything they could to make a space for us so we weren't forced back out into the cold to one of the other countless restaurants in the area.  That is what service is all about, and we were happy to stay.  Many thanks to the serving staff for being so accommodating on a hopping Friday night!

As for the food, it is the expected and welcomed pub spread.  They offer up fish &amp; chips (yes, served in a basket on paper), pot roast and potatoes with buttered peas, and even bangers and mash.  You will find an array of reasonably priced English pub food on the menu, with entrees coming in at about $12 across the board.

As I've said before, I tend to go for the specials, and that night it was Moroccan Stew.  Unfortunately, I am sad to say it was disappointing.  The dish was somewhere between a curry and a Mexican chili, and I was given a healthy serving for the $12.99 price-point.  But, I couldn't help but become envious of those around me who had gravy-topped pot pies, crispy fish and chips, beefy burgers and gooey quesadillas.  I probably would not have been as put-off by the it if it was labelled on the menu, as it was on my bill - just 'vegetable stew'.  It was not as exotic as the name lead me to believe, and with a delicious-looking curry dish on the main menu, I expected more spice and life in my 'Moroccan' Stew special.

For a visit to the Duke, I suggest going full-English.  I saw enough plates of fish and chips go by to convince me that it is a popular item, and how much more traditional can you get than that?  Also, I have the 'famous' deep-fried pepperoni targeted - it has to be famous for a reason!

At the end of it all, the Duke of Kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd, and provides a great atmosphere and service, albeit a bit slow - but hey, it was busy!  My food may have only been so-so, but the brew was cold, and my night was great.</text></sentence><sentence id="161"><text>As soon as you step inside, your first thought will likely be that there is no possible way this place was built to be an Indian restaurant. The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only d&#233;cor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.

Savoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.

Now, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it. It's soft, cooked perfectly, and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor. I've stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else. If you're there, definitely order it.

Pleasantly enough, this place is never at a loss for staff. Any evening you decide to go, you're sure to be taken care of. One of the things--and I cant believe I'm saying this--is that this place may actually be overstaffed. I've gone there before and felt as if I may have been the server's only table, despite being a packed house. It's a true joy to experience.

I know I said that the ugly bar and awkward entrance-way don't matter, and they don't for me. But if you're after more than just amazing Indian food, like say, an authentic setting and traditionally dressed staff, then you may want to keep looking; you won't find that here. What you will find is skillfully cooked, delicious food served to you by exceptionally attentive, friendly staff.</text></sentence><sentence id="162"><text>Bar Salumi is the unassuming sister bar-come-restaurant to The Local Kitchen in Parkdale.  It might be a little too unassuming for its own good, as many people seemed to question its whereabouts when I mentioned its name...but maybe Bar Salumi doesn't like the spotlight.  Indeed, its sign is almost an afterthought, with the store's original signage for an antique shop, dominating the storefront.

My friend and I had been meaning to go ever since she discovered they served Burrata pizza.  She really has a thing for that cheese, and I can't say I blame her. It's delicious.  We went awhile back, excited at the prospect of this new twist on a Margharita pie, only to find out the chef was on vacation and they were only serving up the liquid portion of their menu.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, and in some cases I would actually prefer it, but that night we were hungry and consequently, deflated. My friend entered the chefs ETA in her phone, and we vowed to return.

Two weeks later, the alarm sounded, reminding us that the chef was back to work (and also that she had golden potatoes ready to harvest in Smurf Village).  We went the very next day.

As it was on our previous visit, Bar Salumi was quiet and dark, illuminated by flickering chandeliers (leftovers from the former antique shop maybe?) and tea light candles housed within mason jars.  Hanging legs of prosciutto fight for space with ceiling fans, and a boar's head watches diners from high above on the back wall.  I know it might not sound like it (what with the strong presence of dangling cured meat and taxidermy) but it has a real romantic vibe happening.

There is no kitchen at Bar Salumi, so our personable apron-clad server was also our chef.  The menu is a small one, focused on pizza and apps, so diners can watch as everything is prepared behind the bar. It did get a bit hot, what with the pizza oven operating from within the same room, but think how cozy that would be on a winter's night.

The menu is presented on the wall in cafeteria style (or bowling alley) fashion, with those little plastic letters that slide in and out, and I half expected to see nachos and cheese listed somewhere.  More menus were brought to us on mini clipboards, and because the food menu was unnecessary as we had fully rehearsed our order, we paused awhile over the drink list.  They offer a thoughtful selection of reds and whites as well as some interesting cocktails.  We went with two glasses of Malbec ($12 each) to go with our starter of olives &amp; nodini with ricotta salata ($4).  So far so good, except that I couldn't help but think the nodini crackers weren't the most functional choice for the cheese...more like basketball hoops for the olives.

Our pizza ($14), although not wood-fired, did come served on a cross-section of a tree trunk.  With the creamy white Burrata blending with the red of the San Marzano tomatoes, punctuated by basil it was like an homage to the Italian flag.  I wish I could say that the Burrata we were so looking forward to, made it the penultimate Margharita experience, but it was like any other made with Bufala.  The two are from the same family after all, so I'm not sure what we were thinking.  Cheese does things to people.  That being said however, we weren't disappointed, as the sauce was tangy, the crust was crispy, and it was big enough for both of us to eat and still take home leftovers.

I wouldn't rank the pizza with the likes of pie giants, Terroni or Libretto, but Bar Salumi is rife with ambience where the aforementioned aren't.  The promise of Buratta may have lured me in the first time, but it's the character that will bring me back.</text></sentence><sentence id="163"><text>Hey Meatball! Hey Mediocre! Walking into Hey Meatball! instantly feels like you are walking into your old high school cafeteria. A few two and four person tables are set up, and there's one long 16 person table down the middle, all this in a space that was clearly not built for this many diners. I wasn't entirely sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait for direction. We inquired with the cashier/order taker/owner to find out. I know he was the owner because he told us.

For a restaurant that serves all meatballs, all the time, we were surprised to find that there were only three entr&#233;e selections on the chalk board and a few side dishes to choose from. Of the four side dishes, two had already been crossed out for the day, leaving a side salad or butternut squash soup. I decided to order the vegetarian eggplant 'meatballs' with polenta and parmesan, and my dining partner ordered the Porky  meatballs, (a combination of pork and ground beef) with tomato sauce on spaghetti. Immediately I was told that they were out of polenta and was asked "what would I like it on?" Unsure of my options, even after asking, I replied with "spaghetti," as that was the only thing on the chalkboard that I was sure that they had in stock.

We each ordered a homemade cream soda, we were given a number, and we took a seat. Our number was called out about 10 minutes later, and we immediately noticed the disparity in portion size. My eggplant 'meatballs' were served on a huge swirl of very al dente spaghetti, whereas the porky meatballs arrived on what could be considered an order from the children's menu- if there was one that is.

The food was good, but not great. The eggplant 'meatballs' had a nice consistency, and were spicy and full of flavor. The tomato sauce that the dish was served with was hearty and not too salty, however I thought that the pasta could have been cooked a little more. The Porky meatballs were excellent, the combination of pork and beef proved to be a hit, however we both found that the tomato sauce served with the meatballs was far too sweet for the savory nature of the dish.

The saving grace of the meal was the amazing cream sodas they make fresh on site. They were a throwback to the Jones cream soda that you used to drink as a kid, but without too much fizz. Unfortunately, when the beverage you order to go with your meal is the best part of the experience, you know that there is something missing.

Hey Meatball! is missing the warm and friendly atmosphere you would expect to find in a restaurant with a wide open kitchen, communal tables and a chef that endeavors to use ingredients within a 100-mile radius of Toronto. All great qualities to have in a unique restaurant with a unique concept, but here, it just didn't seem to create anything memorable. There was no music playing while we were in, and the gruff reception and fluorescent lighting that made it a little harsh on the eyes made Hey Meatball! mostly a letdown.</text></sentence><sentence id="164"><text>3030 has young-professional written all over it. Craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its Junction location (sigh, I remember the days when they avoided this area). And although I spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, I only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago. That's mostly because it's a difficult place to notice, with an unassuming, simple '3030 stenciled on the front door, and not much else to identify it.

3030 is huge inside... seriously huge; especially for a place in The Junction. Stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars, it seems more like you're in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant, and that's with good intention. 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a food-venue, and in my opinion, not the other way around (although that's what they go for in the off hours).

One thing's for sure, they put a lot of thought into their draft selection. The back bar has taps full of local-ish craft brews, including Wellington, Beaus, and even some other, more difficult one's to find, like the Junction Craft Brewing's IPA (which was fantastic), a Sawdust City stout, and a Broadhead White. Clearly, they take their beer selection very seriously. The unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on, you get the distinct that they don't want you hanging out there.

Much like you'd expect from a place aimed at young-pros in The Junction (sigh), the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out, with shelves full of board games and walls lined with old-school pinball machines and plenty of interesting art. With the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening, it gives the perfect backdrop to a night out.

But with just a little '5 dollar snack menu' card on each table, you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks. Our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve (there was only 4 of them at the time) but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right. I asked if the items changed daily, hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them, but nope, these items had been here for a while she said. While it's cool to try items out to see what works, I hope that eventually they'll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu, or at least one that changes seasonally.

Because none of their mains sounded appealing to us, we instead opted for the items on the snack menu. The Butter Chicken Wings, while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours you'd expect, arrived lukewarm. The Potato Wedges on the other hand, were indescribably and inedibly  hot, which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways. Overall, we just didn't find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at all.

If you're in the neighbourhood, 3030 may be worth checking out, but I'd say solely for their draft selection; and although the fact that there isn't much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out, I'd wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek. In my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for.

With a Gabby's now opened next door, I remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence. It's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people.</text></sentence><sentence id="165"><text>I know St. Lawrence market is full of great food, but I never would've thought that tucked way in the back of the building I'd find something quite like Buster's Sea Cove.

Keep in mind though, this takeout shop isn't Rodney's or Oyster Boy, and I'm definitely not trying to convince you that it is. In fact, Buster's Sea Cove isn't even in the same boat. At Buster's, you won't find soft lighting, romantic ambience, or table-side service, but what you're pretty much guaranteed to find, is some killer seafood served up really, really quickly.

Fresh-made fish and chips are the staple in this place, but they've got so much more than that. Their huge menu has everything from crab cakes and clam strips to fried oysters and fish-topped salads. And their fish-type sandwiches, something that they happen to do really, really well, are outstanding. I'm not talking about your standard old fried-fish-on-a-bun here; Buster's rivals the best seafood takeout places with crab cake paninis and seared tuna melts sandwiches.

But don't overlook the fish and chips either. This little takeout stand easily delivers one of the best plates of the stuff in the city. They've got a few varieties of fish to choose from, and each of them is served up expertly battered and crispy. Each plate of fish and chips also comes with in-house made fries and a killer slaw.

Buster's also has a few other options you wouldn't expect from a takeout stand. Grilled swordfish, seafood bisque, rainbow trout, even octopus to name a few. It ain't fine dining by any means, but they truly do push the limits of what takeout is both in quality and selection.

Chances are though, once you get your food you'll be spending most of your time searching for a place to eat it. Busters only has 4 tables or so scattered around in front of the counter, but if those are full-and they probably will be-you're on your own. There's an exit close by to the Market's back patio and parking lot where most of Buster's customers end up, but trust me, if it's a nice day out, that'll fill up pretty quick too and you'll be left looking for a place to eat your by-then-getting-cold food.

Truth be told though, even if you're standing out back of the market among parked cars and alleyways, it won't matter all that much. You might not even notice. Whether it's a crab cake sandwich or plate of fish and chips, the food at Buster's is just that dam good.</text></sentence><sentence id="166"><text>This sushi restaurant at the corner of Queen and Caroline is a take-out superstar. You can walk in to place your order or call ahead for pick up or delivery; they add a reasonable $3.00 delivery charge for the area nearby and $5.00 + for further surrounding areas, depending on the distance. If you call with special requests or large party orders, the chefs will accommodate you in a very timely manner - if it's not on the menu, just ask!

Just like the fish, the interior is raw. There is actually one very small table with some chairs around it by the front window, but I've never seen anyone sitting there. There's a display that sits just to the left when you walk in, covered with bags of Japanese snacks for purchase and, on your right, you'll find shelves filled with a few groceries; dried sheets of nori is one recognizable item that jumps out immediately.

Chef John Lee has been serving up fresh and beautiful sushi platters at this location since 2005. It is impressive to note that he worked under the iron chef himself, Morimoto. There is something soothing about the fact that they prepare your food behind the counter in full view. It's that commitment to preparing and presenting the freshest ingredients that has built their dedicated customer base.

Lunch combos range from $15 to $25 and dinner combos from $15 to $35. If you choose the sashimi - individual pieces of raw fish with no rice - it does bring the price up a bit, but it's well worth it for something so delectable. If ordering a la carte is more your style, there are unique rolls to choose from, including: nigiri sushi (fish on rice), small rolls, inside out rolls and special rolls with everything from eel to sea urchin to marinated dried pumpkin.

Our dinner for two was easily fulfilled with the vegetable sushi combo, which includes miso soup, and adding one Una Tekkyu roll (eel, tuna, cucumber, fish roe) and, my sushi must, an order of edamame. The vegetable rolls are prepped delicately to appear as if they too are made with tender slices of fish, the cucumber rolls are a refreshing addition and there is even a roll with an orange, crunchy vegetable called Burdock - carrot-like in appearance and texture, but with a different and unique flavour.

Their fresh ingredients are really the highlight. Nori can easily become chewy and tough, but Marche's is tender and graces the palate without even a hint of the unappealing sea-scent that you might get from a lesser sushi establishment. I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of the cold edamame they serve, but I wouldn't want to trek my raw fish home with something steaming hot resting on top of it anyway, so I don't mind this one pre-prepared item.

If your only sushi experience is picking up a pack of that generic grocery store stuff, with the fake green grass insert, Sushi Marche is really the place to discover all the glory of raw fish.</text></sentence><sentence id="167"><text>Chef Vallins redefines comfort food.

Weekends however, draw a big crowd and my nine-to-five job prevented me from going during the week and avoiding said crowd.  Fortunately, having resigned from my job to be a writer (see: unemployed) I am now afforded the luxury of going to brunch on say, a Tuesday...which is exactly what I did this week.

I love Mitzi's location.  Tucked away on a quiet corner of Sorauren, surrounded by century homes, purple and yellow painted Mitzi's is a bit out-of-place, but that's the appeal.  I have a thing for old neighbourhood general stores, and that's what Mitzi's reminds me of.  Inside looked exactly how I both expected and hoped for; arborite tables with mismatched chairs, a glass display case that housed trays of muffins at the time, and walls adorned with local art.  I really, really wanted to like this place.

And like it I did, however my friend was less than satisfied with her experience.  Let's start with mine shall we?  Mitzi's has a small but thoughtful menu, and I had previously perused it online, so I knew exactly what I wanted.  Craving sweet over savoury, I ordered the French toast as planned ($10.95).  Made with Challah bread it is then topped with a peach &amp; ginger compote, covered in graham cracker crumbs and generously doused with real maple syrup (the last step done by yours truly).  It was fantastic.  The bread was thick and fluffy, and the compote had just the right amount of ginger in it.  It had all the makings of a dessert...in a breakfast.  It should be noted that this dish is typically served with whipped cream, but I decided it was too much of an indulgence (says the person who used so much syrup as to make her French toast wish it had signed up for swimming lessons).

Sitting just adjacent to the expanding pool of syrup, but not completely out of its reach, were the home fries, which offset the sweetness of the French toast nicely.  Made with halved baby potatoes they were spiced perfectly.  My only complaint is that there weren't more of them, but it's probably for the best in the long run.  If the toast itself was the star of the show, then the home fries were the understudy.

As I had already had my morning coffee I chased all of this with a glass of their homemade orange/banana/mango juice.  It was just thick enough to know it was the real thing, and at $3 I think it was good value.

The glowing endorsement ends with my friends order.  She was so looking forward to her poached eggs (also $10.95).  Served on Portuguese cornbread, topped with wilted spinach,  and slathered in roasted red pepper &amp; asiago sauce, it looked delicious when set down in front of her, but as she cut into the egg with her fork, the yolk failed to flow.  Her poached eggs weren't poached at all... they were hard-boiled.  Cue the violins. Tasty yes, but it wasn't what she wanted, and the accompanying rye bread would fail to serve its dipping duty.

This would have been a 4 star review had I made it a solo trip, but alas the poached eggs (or lack thereof) knocked it down a peg.  Mitzi's is still worth a visit though for the French toast (and I hear the Oatmeal Buttermilk Pancakes are pretty killer too), but if it's poached eggs you crave, be specific,...if only for the sake of your toast and its reason for being.</text></sentence><sentence id="169"><text>Relatively new to the King West theatre district, and across the street from the Bell Lightbox is, Paese.  New to the neighbourhood, but not new to the restaurant scene, Paese has been operating out of their Bathurst street location since 1989.  Serving up Italian comfort food in a casual but sleek atmosphere, Paese might give longtime district resident Kit Kat some competition.

With a monochromatic colour scheme, butcher block tables and exposed brick, Paese is very welcoming, even for someone who happened to be dining alone (see: yours truly).

My server brought the customary bread to the table...but this was no ordinary bread and oil. The bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour.  It came with an olive, rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty.  I tried to stop after one slice, but failed miserably.  I managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't staring at it longingly throughout dinner.

Next, came my Beet Caprese Salad ($13).  Grilled beets came topped with a generous portion of mozzarella di bufala, drizzled with pistachio pesto and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.  The combination of flavours and textures worked well together, and it was just a very fresh salad overall. If seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring.  It was filling enough to be my main course, but I wasn't done yet.

As full of bread and beets as I was, I couldn't wait for my cavatelli ($13).  Hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasn't as filling.  The sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers, and that's a compliment as although she wasn't Italian, she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the years.

I had initially sent away the wine menu, although I'm not sure why exactly.  Maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and I had another review to do...but those are hardly excuses not to partake.  It's part of the job after all.  Either way, one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table.  Smart man.

Paese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle, they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass.  Now I'm no expert on wine, but I do drink a lot of the stuff so I know what I like, and I like Amarone.  I was given a sample of a 2004 Fumanelli Amarone before committing to a full glass, after which I gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up.  Rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as I'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...

Because of its location, I probably won't make a repeat visit but I don't think Paese is having a hard time attracting other customers.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show.</text></sentence><sentence id="170"><text>The Bar with No Name recently opened up in the place where the ever-empty Z-Bar used to be, and the signs of them still working out the kinks of being a newly opened place are still there. It was fairly obvious that the space was still in the process of being turned into something else, and there was still a lot of remenants of Z-Bar to be found. I've been to Z-Bar once, and I couldn't really tell the difference between the two, except for the kick-ass, inviting new Bar With No Name sign out front.

Simply put, No Name's staff are amazing, thoughtful, and exactly how food biz staff shoudl be. They were really concerned with making sure we had a good time, and because of them, our experience was good. Even though the place was busy, they still made time to chat with us and didnt make us feel rushed.

No Name's food menu was the standard bar fare. Burgers, wings, and fried foods were front and center, but despite the plainness of the menu, the food was hot, fresh, and served the way it should be.

The music in this place, however, really needs some improvements. We probably would have stayed for another drink if it wasn't for commercials blasted over the radio being the only form of entertainment. I asked if they could put some sattelite radio on, and I was told not to worry because a DJ was going to be playing soon. I left at 1030, and I never saw or heard a DJ, just Leon's, Loblaw's, and car commercials at full volume.

It does seem as though they rushed to open, and they probably could have used another week or two to get things together, but once they get it all worked out, this place stands a great chance at becoming the perfect neighbourhood hangout.

*We plan to review again in two months.</text></sentence><sentence id="171"><text>There is a new kid in town, and his name is Pachuco - named after the look and style of Mexican youth back in the 1930s to 1950s that dressed in zoot suits. Pachuco opened its doors on Friday, January 13th, perhaps a sign of bad luck, but that shouldn't hinder their success.

Pachuco is a small (read: reservations) and cozy space, with exposed brick walls, wrought-iron d&#233;cor and, and a pretty impressive wall of wine bottles lit by a neon sign. Even though Pachuco shares a kitchen with older brother and Danforth favourite  Embrujo Flamenco, they definitely serve up their own distinctive flavour.
Their menu is well thought out and varied, with an excellent selection of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. Their appetizer menu alone is worth the trip. With a confident boasting of guacamole flavours, including goat cheese, blue cheese, smoked trout and walnut, and a guacamole sampler patter that allows you to try three of their creations, there is seemingly no end to the interesting flavour combinations. We decided to stick to our guns, however, and go with the traditional guacamole, which was a stellar choice; lots of lime, onion and creamy avocado, but with no flavour left too overpowering. Their homemade tortilla chips have to be mentioned as well: crisp and tasty. I am hoping they will one day provide these in a to-go bag for purchase before you leave. We also ordered the Chile poblana, swathed in an excellent and perfectly spicy tomato sauce, with queso fresco and refried beans, all baked perfectly. The portion size on both entrees was more than enough for two people, and it could easily serve as a great entr&#233;e.

For our meals (both $15) we went with the Taquitos de Machaca (coffee and ancho braised beef brisket, with guacamole and honey chipotle salsa), and the pre-Hispanic delicacy of Taquitos de Huitlacoche (corn truffle, onions, jalape&#241;o peppers, Cazuela beans served with reques&#243;n-avocado salsa). Where to start? Let's save the most interesting for last. The braised beef was well cooked and well spiced, the chipotle salsa was a great added touch, and one order of beans and rice between the two of us was more than enough to share. In fact, we both left incredibly full. Their fresh-this-second corn tortillas are amazing, sweet, soft and still warm from the press, prepared just the way you would expect to find them in a traditional Mexican eatery. The Huitlacoche, however, was an adventure in and of itself. 

For those who don't know (myself included), Huitlacoche is a fungus, which grows naturally on corn in damp environments. The fungus is harvested and has been consumed as a delicacy for centuries in Central and South America cuisine. When it arrived, it tasted smokey and earthy; it looked like a dark mash of black corn, onion- and was that a jalape&#241;o in there? Hard to tell. The dish was good, but I can't say I would strongly recommend it. Overall, I found the food at Pachuco's to be mostly over-salted, and the Huitlacoche had to be the worst offender. This is the main reason why I would not order it again; although the flavour was very different from any other Mexican dishes I have tried, and I actually did enjoy it, I just could not get over the intensity of the salt. 

The drinks and food at Pachuco's ranged from good to very good, and if they could tone down the salt (margaritas included), I would probably rate most of it as excellent. However, I cannot say our overall experience was excellent, but I would not fault them for it in my overall rating. Being that it was their opening weekend, one expects a few hiccups, and I am sure they will be cleared up by the time you visit. I was served the wrong meal at first, and we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for the Huitlacoche to be prepared, instead of the fish tacos, (though delightful looking), I was initially served. By the time my dish came around, the other half of our meal was cold. Our side plates and used cutlery were never removed from our table after we finished with our appetizers, and the tables are so small and cramped as it is, there was no room for our mains. Instead of removing our side plates, there was a vain attempt to stuff everything on the table. I eventually had to ask for fresh cutlery and removal of the used dishes from our table. Not once, but twice, we almost had our not-quite-finished drinks taken from us, and we had to ask a few times for extra tortillas. It seemed a little strange to me that you would only get four at a time, and as great as they were, they are very, very small, so I imagine each meal would require a minimum of 3 or 4 on its own. 

Overall, I think these are minor complaints, especially since it was Pachuco's opening preview. I found that the service was friendly and genuine, the restaurant was quaint and ambient, with Latin music, candles and a few kitschy d&#233;cor details, which made it seem authentic and allow it to live up to it's self-proclaimed 'Modern Mexican' dining experience.</text></sentence><sentence id="172"><text>Huge Apple Danishes!

I actually went out of my way to go to this place one day when I was craving some good-ole-fashioned-BBQ. Claiming to be serving it up in true Southern-style, I thought that there's no way this could go wrong. I've actually been to Texas and all throughout the Southern states on a fairly serious eating vacation, and lemme tell you something, The Drake and their lil' BBQ place owe the great state of Texas and its surrounding neighbours a serious apology...

Drake BBQ has a slew of great reviews all over the Internet. Everyone on Yelp, Twitter, and a bunch of TO food mags have been raving about the authentic, bad-ass Texas and Carolina style BBQ they've had in this place. I've read so many good comments, that I figured I must have gone to the wrong place. Maybe, I thought, there was some other place that just happens to look exactly the same, on the exact same street, with the exact same type of food?

Nope... I was in the right place. It just sucked is all.

Because they have such a loyal following, I'm sure quite a few people are going to dislike what I'm saying here, but in all honesty, if you got served what I did, you'd be disappointed too. My Carolina pulled-pork sandwich was small, dry, and amazingly enough, was completey void of BBQ sauce, which is a fairly important staple in a pulled-pork sandwich. They must have had some BBQ sauce somewhere in there, but if they did, they didn't offer it to me, and it certainly wasn't on my sandwich. My coleslaw was even worse. It was incredibly bland and wasn't much more than shredded cabbage with a slight trace of what I assume was salad dressing. Not to mention that this stuff was expensive! Two of those sandwiches and an itty-bitty coleslaw-plus tip of course-cost over 20 bucks.

Welcome to The Drake BBQ; it's BBQ with a side of pretentiousness. You don't like it? Trust me. If it's the same guy working behind the counter when I was there, then he won't care at all. I asked if we could get some fries with our sandwiches. he just looked at me, shocked, and said, 'I don't want a deep-fryer in this place'. Hey, I'm fine with the guy being pretentious and true to the stuff he's making and how he's making it, especially if it's honest-to-goodness Southern-style BBQ. If he truly was an artisan of the BBQ and the smoker, he can rightfully be as pretentious as he wants as far as I'm concerned. I probably would have answered back with an agreeing 'Yes Sir'! But the true kick-in-the-ass was that the stuff that I ended up taking home in a sad little brown bag was basically less than edible. In fact, I only took a few bites and ended up throwing it out, which is something I never, ever do. Someone went and filled thsi guy's head with the thought that this is actually what good BBQ is all about; someone lied to him.

Besides being about honest and delicious BBQ, the Southern states are all about hospitality and genuine people; people that would never be rude or unwelcoming. They're more likely to invite you in for dinner than they are to turn you away. Drake BBQ was none of those things. The service was rude, inhospitable, and unwelcoming. From the moment I walked in, I felt as though they wanted me the hell outta there. That is, except for the older guy that handed me the bag. He sent me off with a sincere sounding 'thanks for your business', which is something I think businesses don't say enough these days.

Like I said, this was painful for me. I felt ripped off. I felt sad. I felt let down. It was a just a plain bad experience that was nothing close to true Southern BBQ or Southern hospitality. In fact, I don't think I would even give it another go, and whether you've been exposed to true Southern BBQ or not, I'd suggest you don't either, because you'll feel let down either way too.</text></sentence><sentence id="174"><text>Tapas seem to be all the hype recently. And it's easy to see why. Not only does it allow you to try more things on the menu, but it's also perfect for when you're  with a larger group. And that is just the reason why a couple of my friends and I headed to the Ossington area to try out Foxley, an Asian-Vietnamese inspired tapas house.

The restaurant ambiance doesn't mimic anything I typically associate with a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. It has a classier fine dining style of d&#233;cor with ginger brick walls and soft lighting; it's a  perfect romantic date spot. In fact, we saw lots of couples there that night all dining on a few plates and enjoying wine.

My friends and I decided to follow suit, so we split a bottle of red and ordered the most interesting dishes that caught our eyes on the menu. This however, was a task easier said than done. The menu comes on a single-sided laminated sheet, with no pictures. It was hard to distinguish where the descriptions of one dish started and the next one ended. It felt a little like reading an essay! But once you get over the poor formatting, you'll be amazed by the variety of dishes that they offer. There is no shortage of exotic meats and dishes, like frog legs and beef hearts. But if you're not feeling that adventurous, rest assured they also do have many good old reliable classics, like deep fried shrimps, steamed mussels, and spring rolls.

The first dish that came was the Lamb and Duck Prosciutto Dumplings" ($7). These were served hot,crunchy and  with jam packed with minced lamb stuffing. They're tasty, but nothing too special..

Next came a Sea Bream Creviche with Yuzu and Shiso ($15). They're bite sizes pieces of thinly sliced sea bream sashimi, covered with coriander and some lime puree. I actually found them to be a little too citrusy for my liking, but it is undeniably fresh. It was paired well with the crunchy fried onions generously sprinkled on top.

After that, a whole slew of dishes came at the same time, and it was difficult to figure out which one to dig into first; they all looked and smelled so appetizing! The Grilled Marinated Beef Short Ribs ($14) came on a small plate with about 3-4 pieces. A little too chewy for my liking, but it was at least well marinated and flavourful. In comparison, the Grilled Side Ribs with Caramelized Shallot Glaze ($9.00) were delicious. They were made up of two long pork ribs covered in a savory sweet glaze, with meat that fell right off the bone. We literally demolished that dish in a couple of seconds!

If you're a big fan of pork belly as I am, then you'll be in for a real treat at Foxley. They serve a Slow-braised Pork Belly in Muscatel Reduction ($15) with nicely marbled fat and cooked in a delicious smokey barbeque sauce ;it just melts in your mouth!

And while all those dishes were great, my favourite of the night was the Grilled Beef Heart with Chili Lime Salsa ($8). We ordered it just to try something new, and it was the best decision of the night! It came nicely grilled on two skewers so that the hearts are slightly charred on the outside for flavour, and still tender on the inside. Don't be afraid to try this one, it actually doesn't taste as farfetched as it sounds!

To balance out all the meat we ordered, the chef recommended the Kale Salad with Pecorino Toscano and Lemon Dressing ($8). I love kale, so in my books this salad was definitely a good order. My only complaint was that the lemon vinaigrette was a bit too sour.

Upon finishing up the meal, the first thought I had was that Foxley is not as "Asian fusion" as I had anticipated. There are some influences, but not nearly enough for me to notice the Asian aspect of the menu. That does not go to say that I didn't enjoy my meal though. While I found it was a little on the pricier side, I did enjoy the food and the romantically sophisticated atmosphere. Keep Foxley in your books for either your next date night venue or for a quiet relaxing dinner out with friends.</text></sentence><sentence id="175"><text>Disgraceland isn't bad, but it's definitely a bit overrated. Thier biggest fault is that it's completly hit-or-miss. Somedays everything comes together, other times... 

Their menu takes an exceptionally creative look at stuff you'd expect to find in the southern states with heavy concern for those that prefer meatless. Everything from Southern-fried chicken and Tenessee pulled pork sandwiches to grilled veg stew and fried tofu sandwiches. They also have a fairly original selection of sauces to dip your fries in that's worth mentioning. The staff are cool, layed-back, and they actually seem to care that you're there.

But like I said, all of that can change the next time you go in. Food could come out luke warm and greasy, staff could be stuck-up and simply not care. 

Disappointingly enough, the one thing that you can count on that Disgraceland has that is consistently great, is one hell-of-a cool name.</text></sentence><sentence id="176"><text>I came across The Burger's Priest purely by accident one day when I was biking in the Beaches neighbourhood. It's an easy little place to overlook; it's just a small shop with little advertising way out on Queen East. But boy am I ever glad I stumbled onto this place. Hands down this was one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto. 

First off, it was actually cooked a little over medium-- without me asking! Truly a rarity nowadays, the guy at the counter told me they always cook it that temperature. Beautiful. Besides being cooked perfectly, the burger was served on a soft and slightly sweet bun that was matched perfectly with the savoury patty.

The fries are cut super skinny and fried crispy in-house. While that makes them perfect for eating right away, I do imagine that takeouters will find them soggy once they get to eat them. But for me, it was pure fry bliss.

The space is modern, clean, and stainless-steel heavy, but because of it's size, it only has seating for about 4 people. Once the place gets a lineup, which at peak times is completely inevitable, the seating area gets really cramped and is unpleasant to eat in.

Next time you happen out to the Beaches, definitely check this place out, or even if you're not in the neighbourhood, this place is totally worth the drive.

It has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent.  I chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons.  It checked a lot of boxes on my list.  I won't be going back.

This past weekend found me turning another year older, and because I've been experimenting with a gluten-reduced diet as of late, I decided my birthday dinner should be had at the Kensington Cornerstone.  I looked at pictures.  I perused the menu.  I read reviews.  It all seemed positive.

It was a beautiful evening, so I was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio.  We had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken, but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings, people watching (Kensington offers some of the best), and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street. 

Just when I was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables' pitcher of beer, our waitress appeared.  The up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals, so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time.  While we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria (and/or mojitos, and/or margaritas), we all ended up opting for beer.  My girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of Upper Canada Lager, while I decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections.  I figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop, so I stuck to my guns.  I've had what Nicklebrook has to offer in the line of GF beer, so I was looking forward to trying a new one.  I asked our server what the most popular one was, and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by La Messagre that operates out of Montreal.

When our drinks arrived, I took that first sip so full of hope, and for a split second I thought I was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend (I know, I'm nice aren't I?) that my beer didn't taste horrible.  I didn't have that chance.  Did I just drink beer?  Or did I just suck on a penny?  Even I was a bit confused at that point.  It started off so well, but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat.  Bitter...just like I was at that point.

So by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered.  Our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish.  Thank goodness our server was coming our way!  But instead of food, she came bearing bad news.  My girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out, and for some reason, they just thought to tell her now.  Not only would we have to wait even longer for our food, but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us. 

(Sound of clock ticking)

Another half hour passed and our meals finally arrived.  As hungry as I was I couldn't make it through my sandwich ($13).  It looked appetizing enough, but the pork wasn't nearly as tender as it should have been (I've been spoiled by the likes of Fidel Gastro lately), and the sauce was a bit of a turn-off, being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro.  The gluten free bread was quite good, and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice, so it was now more of a sponge.  Yes, a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy, but you should still be able to pick it up. 

My mom was impressed with her salmon ($18), but she wouldn't complain if there was a gun to her head.  It did look good though, and the portion was generous, so not all was lost.

Looking back on it now I wish I had just scrapped the GF diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant.  What was I thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner?  Why did I go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something I love on my special day?  Who does that?  So while I'm not taking the blame away from the restaurant, I will share some of it with them...but only some as the service was really what ruined our experience.  Maybe the food wasn't amazing, but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult.  The servers themselves were lovely girls, but somewhere back in the kitchen, the ball was dropped. 

After we begrudgingly paid our bill, I decided to throw the whole GF thing out the window and head to Ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note. As we sat there on the patio I couldn't help but stare across the road at The Grilled Cheese.  Oh, what could have been.</text></sentence><sentence id="178"><text>i got a pair of  loupes from snap on optics.  i love them, they are light and very well designed. Ray, the owner, is so professional and helpful on the phone.  He only needs my eye prescription and my picture in order to make the loupes and i don't even have to come in his office. the loupes are amazing, i could see much better and my dental work came out excellent. i am so happy to have these loupes. also their light is bright and i could see very clearly. i would highly recommend snap on optics loupes and light  to anyone i know.  thanks so much Ray and Snap on optics.</text></sentence><sentence id="179"><text>What a nice and friendly person that answered the phone.  I was looking for a tree nut free cupcake she was unfortunately not able to help me but gave me great advice and was very willing to give me a few suggestions.</text></sentence><sentence id="180"><text>I have been here 3 1/2 years.   The staff is always smiling and helpful.   Yes it takes maintenance a little longer then they should but it seems like a large place for only 2 guys to handel.   The fitness center needs a little upgrade but I have lived at other places and this is a great place.  I see a few people complaining and name calling which I find childish.  If they hate it so much why don't they move.</text></sentence><sentence id="181"><text>I am going on a long vacation out of the country and talked to DISH on Sept 19. 2016. I told them to cancel my service on Sept 30, 2016. I also was told to give them notice at least two before to get the return boxes. I did this on the 19 and was told the boxes would be sent. Now on the 27 no boxes. I called again the agent said they were sent wait two more day now the 29 no boxes. I just called today to find out the boxes were never sent. I am leaving on October 4, 2016. The person said they would try to get the boxes to me before October 3 and also gave me a number of one of there retailer outlet. This was to see if they would pick up the equipment they said they could not if they did I would be charged month to month. This again shows DISH has no service or communication within their company. I am very disappointed that I have been lie to by over three representative. I do not expect to see the boxes for the return in the time they promised. I would not recommend this company if something as easy as this cannot be processed.</text></sentence><sentence id="182"><text>This place is not just a restaurant has a great bar and a outside deck with one of the best views of Las Vegas. The food is good and selections is limited. Drink are on the expensive side and it is a private club. I would recommend there steak with crab. It has a disco at night at 10 pm the space is small and can be crowded. I would recommend this place and I am going back again.</text></sentence><sentence id="183"><text>It great fast food and get large portions. It seem to be fresh and the server are friendly. I gone there many time and it alway good. I like their burritos usually it so big can only eat half and save the rest. I am recommending it to all my friends. You can choose what you want with any of the items on the menu.</text></sentence><sentence id="184"><text>I went there a couple week ago. The service was great small place. I had there osso buco meat it was good so much could only eat half. Wine was good by the glass a Malbec. I and my friend had there seafood soup was very good. I would recommend you try this place</text></sentence><sentence id="185"><text>I call them to switch to their service for both TV and Internet. They schedule a service Tech to come out to my home on Saturday between 12 and 2 pm. I was home to make sure I would be there when they arrived. 2 PM no one arrived it was on Saturday I tried to call there service. There office was closed and no way to get a hold of anyone. Now I still waited to 4 PM still no call finally I got a call but it said un know number. I got a message they were at my service box again no one was even close to my home. I called them Monday morning asking what was the problem they told me I could not get service for TV in my area really. After they had schedule a appointment and there customer service people did not even know they could not give me these services. I wasted a whole Saturday waiting for these people. Their customer service is horrible do not waist your time. Now I know why they have such a low rating.</text></sentence><sentence id="186"><text>Great fast food restaurant large portions. The food is good taste and great bargains. The service is good the restaurant is clean. I had the Teriyaki hot chicken with rice and steam vegetables. Had enough food for two meals would recommend this restaurant for familes</text></sentence><sentence id="187"><text>Just had dinner here last night Got there at 5:15 very few people at this time but did fill up in the next hour. I had the SEAFOOD PAPPARDELLE (shrimp, lobster, scallop, basil, saffron-tomato sauce) $ 30 The bread was fresh but to salty for my taste
This was delicious the sauce had good body and had real body with great taste. The large noodles were great with good portions. It was perfect did not over eat and was so good I finished every bit. I would recommend this restaurant and will go back again. Its know as steak house so next time will try the steaks. They also have a brunch maybe will try this. Its located across from the Lucky Dog Restaurant</text></sentence><sentence id="188"><text>I was just at their new store on Cheyenne on Sunday. I wanted a soft mattress Christine gave me a great selection. I told her I only wanted to spend up to $1200 dollars. I had more than 4 choices all were less than I had planned. I had checked other stores first and the mattress I got was equal or even better at half the price. They even gave me sheet and cover for the mattress as a bonus for shopping at the new store. I did not realize they also sold furniture pick up a full 5 piece bedroom set. It was just like the ones I had been looked at some of the bigger furniture stores again half the price. I going to tell all my friend check this store first.</text></sentence><sentence id="189"><text>Its a nice club open air with swimming pools there are two levels of private areas overlooking the pools.

My husband and I rescued Pepper and knew he was the dog for us despite the expected behavior problems coming from a rescued pup! She helped me identify the core of our issues with Pepper, and we faced them head-on! I had a perfectly behaved dog inside my apartment; sit, stay, free, park it (code for go lay down)- no problem! Our struggle was on walks and going anywhere. Pepper is an incredibly protective pup, and any dog or cat we saw, from any distance, would evoke jumping and barking which was incredibly impactful on our lifestyle. I had zero control over him outside of the apartment. Brenda taught me how to gain control outside of my home, and brought a variety of different dogs to increase Pepper's tolerance to dogs and to practice my new favorite term "LEAVE IT!". 

Long story short, we are still working everyday to improve Pepper's socialization, but we recently had a doggy play date and he did AMAZING! I can go on walks without an overwhelming feeling of panic, walk by cats without worry, and can even take the occasional hike when we know we only have to practice "leave it" a few times :) I am no longer afraid to take our dog for a long walk, or to bring him to new places!</text></sentence><sentence id="195"><text>I do NOT recommend this store. They were so bad it actually made me set up a Yelp account so that I could review them. A friend sent flowers for my birthday which they tried to deliver late in the afternoon when I was not at home.  When the girl called she said that they would redeliver the flowers the next morning. I told her to bring them to my neighbor as that I would not be at home. My neighbor waited at home till 12 noon and no flowers arrived.  I  got home at 12 and called them and said where are my flowers?  The woman apologized and said that her supervisor would give me a call. Of course, no call. So, I called them yet again. They said they were on the truck and would be here by the end of the day.  Once again no flowers. So I called again and said, hey it's almost closing time for you where are my flowers? The answer was don't worry they'll be there.  They weren't.  Next morning my father waited at my house for the delivery of the missing flowers. Of course again no flowers.  So I called them at 12 noon again and said if I do not have them by the end of the day I would be coming into the store personally and picking up my flowers or canceling the order for my friend. Shockingly, the flowers showed up a half hour later. Of course, they were no longer in the best condition. They weren't horrible but they weren't the freshest either. Of course they were now almost 3 days late. I would NOT recommend this store. They didn't even seem to care that was the worst part.</text></sentence><sentence id="196"><text>Great authentic addition to champaign. Dario and Alessio have done an incredible job and I can't wait to go back again and again!</text></sentence><sentence id="197"><text>I have passed this spot hundreds of times but being a creature of habit, I have never stopped to try, opting instead for Fenwick's (Oh! Fenwick's-- must write a review!)which is almost next door.  When I found a coupon in our Citipass book for a free sushi roll, I decided to give it a try.

Unassuming atmosphere, which I appreciate.  Generally, when I dine, I am looking for a food experience, espeically in this price-point.  They have a very limited wine list, and a very limited beer selection, no cocktails!  Which, again, is all fine... who can't enjoy a Tsing Tao?

We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a summer roll (special roll of the evening), and a crunchy roll.  My husband enjoyed all of them.  I, on the other hand, don't love spicy mayo on all of my rolls, so I enjoyed but did not love.  But, for the price, it is definitely worth a try.  I fear I have turned into a sushi snob :(

Our service was fine.

Tip-- Wear a sweater!  It was freezing in there!</text></sentence><sentence id="198"><text>This is a fine place to dine but nothing special.  I do appreciate that they have vegetarian chili which is the perfect topping for their taco salad.  The taco salad is good, as are the huge baked potatoes.  

Kids dine free at McAlister's on various evenings, but the kids menu is not great and the portions are for toddlers. 

This is a quick in and out, and in the winter a good place to grab a cup of soup, as the offerings change daily.  

The sweet tea gets 4 stars.</text></sentence><sentence id="199"><text>Jalapeno Pale Ale?  Yes, please!  Mexicali Stout?  Yep!  The on-site brewed beer here is awesome.  Creative, delicious and local.  A perfect hat trick of beers!

They had a great accoustic singer who started in the afternoon but got talked into playing into the evening... he was fantastic.

The atmosphere is pretty bare-bones, which is nice.  A long picnic table, some bar tables and some covered outdoor seating that I cannot wait to try.  It was COLD in there, my husband wore his coat and I used mine as a blanket... 

The service is friendly.  The crowd, as usual for NODA, is ecclectic and fun, friendly and non-pretentious.  They also offer a 1/2 gallon fill-up to go, or to enjoy on-site, which was a great price at $14.

Bonus: they serve peanuts.</text></sentence><sentence id="200"><text>Seriously? This restaurant has 4 crepe options on the menu for dinner.  Totally disappointed. The spinach and mushroom crepe was delicious but it was the only vegetarian option.  Call me crazy, but with a name like "Crepe Cellar" I imagined several options...

The tap beers are a sampling of the UK... Which is great but the best local brews are a block away.

The atmosphere is nice.  We sat at the bar.  My hubs had the fish and chips, which he enjoyed.  We skipped dessert.  MIght be a better option for brunch?</text></sentence><sentence id="201"><text>My 5 year old attended art camp here with a friend.  It was a 3 hour camp and when I realized it was only 4 days instead of 5, the value of this camp sharply decreased... oh!  but wait a minute... they released a coupon for pay for one child and the second goes free!  Score!  This only worked for me because I had not paid for our session yet.  Had I already paid, this deal would not have applied.  Imagine how disappointed my responsible, early-paying friend was when she realized the offer was not available to her!

The camp itself was well run and organized.  The art work was adorable.  My daughter had a great time and did not get too messy!  They also gave them fun snacks.

The camp is advertised for up to age 10 but my "free" 10 year old only went twice as it is really geared toward the younger children.</text></sentence><sentence id="202"><text>I love a lot of things and live music is at the top of my list.  This venue has a great old school place feel and is a fun place to take in a show.  It appeared to be cement from floors to ceiling, with two different stages- one for a bigger show and one for a smaller crowd. (It is definitely not the Belk Theatre but I cut my teeth at the Milestone, so a grungy-ish venue is fun for me). There were pool table(s), a few booths and bar tables near the bar, and a great outdoor area with seating and fun, colorful lights.  The bartenders were friendly and they have a great selection of beer on tap-- and the beer is reasonably priced!  They also have a full bar... but with some good local beers on tap, why not support our budding QC brewery market?

The accousitcs were fine.  But, I enjoyed the Prince concert at TWC which received awful reviews for accoustics... 

I am jazzed about another great venue from which I can get my music fix!  Psychedelic Furs, anyone?</text></sentence><sentence id="203"><text>Target at Midtown is a fantastic shopping experience, especially if you happen to have Val as your cashier.  She is a smack-talking hoot!

Seriously, with parking that protects you from rain and all aisles usually open, how can you not love this Target?  

Don't get me wrong, I am all about shopping local, but with 3 children that need a dump truck load of back-to-school supplies, Target is my choice.  And, seriously, where else can you pick up a cute top, scarf and set of sheets, while simultaneously loading up a cart with colored pencils, paper, and notebooks?  (And their junior dept. clothes, while tricky to find smaller sizes, are hard to distinguish from pricier brands... a huge bonus to this mother of a middle schooler).</text></sentence><sentence id="204"><text>I am not a 5-star person.  I think everyone/everything has room for improvement.  But, Fenwick's?  They are spot-on, delicious every time.  

This is owned and operated by Catherine, of Catherine's on Providence for any old-time Charlottean.  She is a superb chef!  Her culinary and wine skills are some of the best in Charlotte.

This is not fine dining.  It is not fancy.  In fact, it is quirky and small and you often feel a little close to your dining neighbor.  

Must try:  Tomato Bisque Soup, it comes as a side option with their meals.  My hubbie says these are the best burgers in Charlotte... I am a veggie, and I beleive their grilled veggie burger is the best in town.  Their fries are great.  Sweet potato fries?  Delicious!  Tuna salad, with  melt-in-your-mouth croutons and an array of homemade dressings to choose from?  Pure yumminess.  My husband also adores the club sandwich.  Oh, and the muffins.  Delectable!

As creatures of habit, my order is always the same: Veggie burger, with cheese, side of soup and fruit.  And this is a 5-star meal delivered with 5-star service.  

Sit at the bar and get to know your neighbors!

Pretty tight for families with children... I don't bring my younger ones in here.</text></sentence><sentence id="205"><text>Me loves!

The stir fried wide noodles are perfection!  

The make your own spring rolls are my favorite... a big plate overflowing with fresh mint, basil, cilantro, noodles, bean sprouts, cucumber, and tofu.  Soak your rice wrap in the hot water, fill with goodness, squirt with siriachi, and dip in sauce.  Delight taste buds.  Repeat. Again and again.

The atmosphere is nothing to write home about but with authentic food like this, who cares?

--Restroom is yucky, bring sanitizer--
--My kids love this dining experience--</text></sentence><sentence id="206"><text>This has been a favorite for 13 years or more.  I have tried a lot of the menu items and have never been disappointed, but my favorite remains the make-your-own spring rolls.  A close second is the vegetable hotpot, and my children love (like squeal-out-loud love) the fried pineapple rice-- it arrives in a pineapple boat and it is delicious.

First off-- you do not come here for atmosphere.  They have gussied the place up a bit with some fake bamboo and updated posters on the walls.  The fact that you can see a run down laundromat and a car inspeciton station that may or may not be boarded up should not deter you from this spot.  

Do come for the hot tea, the service, and the food.  It is outstanding.  Although, the rumor is the "original" Lang Van owners are now the owners of Ben Thanh (which might explain my love affair with that restaurant).  The staff is so helpful and knowledgable in assisting with food selections.  We have taken several people here for their first visit and our waitperson has always helped make selections that were enjoyed by our guests!

The food is plentiful.  You will not leave here hungry!  Flat noodles, hot pots and spring rolls are our favorites (and the aforementioned fried pineapple).  We also love the little cookies that come with the check... perfectly sweet but do have peanuts.

--This is a FUN place to bring a small group of people (6ish) to sit around a round table and share food.--

--This is a great restaurant for children to experience delicious and healthy food.  The servers dote on well-behaved children here.--</text></sentence><sentence id="207"><text>I cannot say enough about this church and I don't know where to start!

Aside from the obvious, the church is utterly gorgeous, the people are what make this place truly spectacular.  There is a widely diverse population at this church, which can be surprising to new visitors.  There is a Buddhist group that meets here, a Sunday School class for LGBT and friends, and people of all colors.  The minister here is Stephen Shoemaker and he is incredibly educated, intellectual and compassionate.  He is a pillar in the faith community in Charlotte.  The outreach of this church is also impressive.  Service projects and taking care of thy neighbor abounds here.

There are great Sunday School classes for adults and children alike.  The little ones often are found riding tricycles in the gym after SS and during the church service.  There are sports teams, a gym, art classes, computer classes, etc... offered here.  We have participated in many and loved them all.

They also have really great small group offerings-- interested in art?  drinking beer at pubs?  going to movies?  and somehow tying this back into Christianity?  Or maybe you want to be an earth keeper, a hiker or a yogi?  They have it all.

My favorite thing about this church?  No need to check your intellect at the door.</text></sentence><sentence id="208"><text>Dr. Eap is a healer in the truest sense of the word.  She not only has her Naturopathic degree from one of the most esteemed programs in the country, she also lived and studied with ancient healers and monks in Asia.  She is a true holistic practitioner-- mind, body, spirit.  This is an experience unlike any other...

She uses kinesiology to test the body for weaknesses.  She then prescribes any array of herbal supplements, and other unconventional treatments.  Sometimes it feels a little voo-doo-ish, but conventional doctors are just "practicing" medicine and dispensing potent drugs with known side effects... both seem scary to me, but the natural approach seems less so.  And, honestly, I showed up barely able to function from tiredness and fatigue, beaten up from medical procedures and under the care of an oncologist (for a noncancerous condition).  She really restored my energy.

I credit Dr. Eap for restoring my health back to a place of wellness.  

--It is expensive and not covered by insurance--
--I eventually had to stop going, the supplements were getting to be too many for me to keep up with--
--I will definitely go again, when my pocketbook and time can manage it--</text></sentence><sentence id="209"><text>Great, knowledgeable and friendly service: first the nice manboy (not sure how old he is... looked like a baby, acted like a polite adult) was awesome in making sure I was buying the best helmets for my kids.  He went in and out of their stock room several times to get it all correct.  Secondly, he asked if I needed boxes (I didn't have to arm wrestle him for them!) and he was genuinely excited when he found out I was Santa(they loaded all my Christmas loot into my sleigh that looks like a Suburban).   They also have the cutest chocolate lab that is in here on occasion.  Seriously, who does not love the beautiful face and aggressive wagging of the tail of a lab?    This place has all the snow and skateboard gear one might need.  Great priced helmets for skating and skiing, great penny board selection.  

The Tom's, Ugg, Sanuk and Rainbow shoe selection is insane.  Seriously, blows Nordstrom out of the water... kids and adult sizes!  And Sanuks are hard to find... my husband loves them and so does my brother in law (who is a surgeon and on his feet all day).  They are also hip without being hipster :)  But, with skinny jeans could def fall into the hipster category!</text></sentence><sentence id="210"><text>I love Dr. Sowell and all of his office staff.  I could not find it in me to give a dentist 5-stars.  I dread, and I do mean, DREAD going to the dentist. 

His hygenists are awesome.  Melissa is my favorite.  HIs front desk staff is wonderful.  For those suffering from severe dental anxiety, he will give a magic pill 30 minutes prior to any work to be done.  I have not done this... yet.

He also sees well-behaved children. That said, he sees 2 of 3 of mine ;) and is great with them.

--their reschedule policy is difficult-- don't cancel appointments!</text></sentence><sentence id="211"><text>With $1.00 Icees (cherry, coke or mixed) and .50 cent vanilla ice cream cones, this is a great place to treat children to something "special."  The indoor play area is clean and never crowded.  

BK also offers veggie burgers but make sure to ask them to hold the mayo if you do not want your sandwich swimming in it.</text></sentence><sentence id="212"><text>I do love this park, really, I do... but, I do not feel safe here by myself or alone with my children, hence the 3 stars. In fact, I was stopped by a police officer who told me as much.  So, with 3 children in tow, we loaded up and went to another park.  I was thankful he told me this, as I was feeling like that but felt I was being paranoid.  Without that significant detail, this would be a 4 star park.  

I think the little splash park is big fun for younger children, although it can get quite crowded and there are, as always, those parents who do not monitor their children's behavior.

The playground is super fun!  Big, fast slide and great swings.  Great recycled plastic chips in lieu of mulch.

Awesome picnic shelter and wonderful, open field for kick ball or soccer.

Nice winding paths that feel like you are really in the woods instead of steps from one of Charlotte's cutest neighborhoods.

--I did find several used condoms on the playground and on the lovely walking paths.  

This is not a "go-to" park for me... Charlotte has too many wonderful options.</text></sentence><sentence id="213"><text>I love this park.  I love the tennis courts.  I love the lake (or pond?).  I love the aggressive geese that steal picnic dinners out of unsuspecting children's hands.  I love the interesting people that study, read, and play frisbee on "hippie hill".  I love the bridge to the band shell.  I love the yoga that is offered here on occasion.  I love the caddywampus dogs that people are walking here.  I love the random fishermen.  I love catching a little bit of a baseball game here.  I love the train.  I love the second playground with its big sandbox and swings.  I love the nature trails.  BUT, the thing I love the most is having a picnic in this park on a lovely day-- loading my car with scooters and bicycles and balls and dolls and watching my children behave wildly!  I also love the lacrosse for girls offered by CYLA at this park.  

--Festival in the Park is a fun (but crowded) event held here annually.
--lots of charity walks and runs here...
--bathrooms are at your own risk!  yucky!</text></sentence><sentence id="214"><text>The Leo has to be one of the best salads in Charlotte; with its chopped lettuce and mint and parsley, cucumber and tomatoes it cannot get into my mouth fast enough!  The pita that comes with it is perfect for sponging up the remaining lemon vinegarette that is too tasty to waste.

I like the falafel here, too.  Crispy on the outside and not mealy on the inside.  My hubs likes the meat specials and gyro.

and the baklava?  like taking a bite out of an angel.</text></sentence><sentence id="215"><text>I love this Teeter! Not as overwhelming as the Taj M'Teeter.  I generally find a good parking place and they generally have all otheir lanes open with a bagger in each lane.  I appreciate all of those things!  

If you shop VIC specials, the Teeter is a good value.  You will shoot your wad if you run in here unprepared, without a list in hand!

The management at this store is incredibly gracious.  I brought home some HT Organic Milk that was spoiled.  I returned it and they refunded my money and gave me the name brand equivalent.  

My kids love all the samples they have out in the store.  Bonus!</text></sentence><sentence id="216"><text>One of life's most frustrating experiences is shopping for  (and with ) a middle school daughter.  She chose this as our destination.  Really, I was ready to open my wallet and just be done.  Too bad the sales staff was unhelpful and a little... rude.  I asked them, very pointedly, for help.  I knew my daughter would trust their opinion more than mine (and they were both wearing those mullet shirts --you know long in the back, short in the front-- and, well, that is just not a style I am able to work with, so I did not just want their help, I *needed* their help).  They nonchalantly pointed to a section of clothes that she "might" like.  I inquired about help with sizing, to which, again, I was met with no offer of help.  She tried on a few things but she was frustrated with sizing and I was annoyed, so we left, empty handed.

To be sure, this is not my style of clothing, but I know there are some school friends that have picked up some cute clothes in here.  With all the options available in Charlotte, and when I am paying full-retail pricing (to be fair-- their retail pricing is affordable/reasonable, hence 3 stars), I expect better and more helpful service.  

I opened my wallet somewhere else... where I got to sit and watch the salesgirls work their magic and help my daughter feel a little special.</text></sentence><sentence id="217"><text>Great place to watch a game.  On Sundays they have a make-your-own Bloody Mary bar which is outstanding.  They are also cheap-- $4 (I think) and also have a Mimosa special.  

I have not eaten a meal here.  I have had the pimento cheese dip (which was an awful consistency-- think not-all-the-way melted Velveeta), I have seen the wings, and had a various assortment of fried bar food.  It was all fine.  My friends thought the burger was delicious-- both were suffering from the liquor flu so I am not trusting their judgment 100%.

The service here has never been good.  

The location works.  The back patio is fun (has its own bar) and the Bloody Mary bar is fun.  This is a place to go and drink, not go to eat.  And don't be surprised if you have to get your own drink from the bar because your server is no where to be found.

Maybe I am just disgruntled.  I miss the Press box being here...</text></sentence><sentence id="218"><text>I love The Fillmore.  I was between 4 and 5 stars and the reason I went with 4 stars is because I paid $18 on Wednesday night for two Bud Lights.... and I think that is ridiculous.  And I am not a fan of the VIP seating they had on the second level for the Willie Nelson concert... it took up way too much room, making the venue feel a little overcrowded.  These seats were not there for the Black Crowes or Five for Fighting and I prefer them not to be there the next time I am lucky enough to take in a show here.

The bathrooms are great here, which is an added bonus and a surprise!

This venue is fantastic for those who love to get up close and for those who want a more intimate setting for a show.  Really, Willie was spectacular and I loved the small venue for such a big man.  It makes it nearly impossible to think of going to a coliseum/arena event.

Shows often sell out, so buy tickets early!</text></sentence><sentence id="219"><text>I am a fan of Slate Interiors!  I love the art, the unique tables, lamps, chairs, chandeliers, home accessories, etc.. There is always something unique here that I want to take home with me.  It is the type of place that makes you dream of how you might decorate a beach house, a mountain house, a contemporary house, etc.. The prices are reasonable on most things.  Occasionally, I feel like the pricing has no rhyme or reason.

They tend to have great mid-century pieces but these move quickly!  A lot of their merchandise turns over, so it is always a new shopping experience.  If you see it and you want it-- BUY IT!  I have lost several great things because I wanted to "think about it."

The place is overflowing with wonderful local art.  I have noticed these pieces don't seem to sell as quickly as the furniture.

For the most part, the booths are well laid out with lovely inventory.  There are a few that could use a good makeover.

The people who work here are friendly, though I did buy an set of something and received a phone call that the price tag on the item was incorrect, it was not for both pieces of the pair but had been priced per item.  I was told I could either pay the new price or return the items.  I opted to return the items and they wanted it back within 24 hours.  As this was their mistake, and I live across town, I thought this was poor customer service.  

All in all it is in my top 5 places to browse interior goods.</text></sentence><sentence id="220"><text>I would give zero stars, if I could.  We hired H &amp; S to install new brackets on our gutters around our entire house-- we were told they also should have been screwed in rather than nailed, and they would do that, too.  They came, "did it", I paid and they left.  Only, they did not do it.  My husband got up on the roof to blow leaves and NOT ONE new bracket had been installed.  The assumption that I have made in regards to this is they had no idea that I am married to someone who still blows his own leaves and cleans his own gutters and thought that we would never know the work was not done.  

They have come out to do the job properly.</text></sentence><sentence id="221"><text>I wanted to love this place.  Really, I did.  It is so close to home, I was hoping it would be a "go-to" place for my hubs and me.  Not so much.

The interior is lovely.  The water feature is really cool.  I love the tile.  I hope to find it for a backsplash in my kitchen.  Yes, those are the thoughts that were going through my head as my uninspired meal arrived.

The berry mojito was good.  The wine list is nice and reasonably priced.  The service was.... weird.  Maybe because we were one of only three tables in there on a Saturday night but, we felt like we were being stalked.

Seaweed salad-- great.  Hard to really mess this up.  House salad with ginger dressing-- ok, here is where I show my odd palate-- I prefer iceberg with my ginger dressing, not field greens.  But, field greens are fancier, so field greens is what I got.  Fine (no stars taken off for this).

The rolls-- spicy tuna, a special roll, and a few slabs of shashimi.  All ok.  Not wowwonderful. Not even, wow! And pricey. And small (which I prefer, but my hub was disappointed).  I get that I am paying for atmosphere, too.  BUT, there was NO ONE there, which felt a little creepy.  Or sad.  Even our server seemed sad.  The atmosphere, lovely water feature aside, was odd.  

3.5 but I rounded down.</text></sentence><sentence id="222"><text>Awful service. Rude hostess. Rude waitress. If you want to clear your dining room out by 10, DONT seat people at 9:30. I'll never return. There are way too many great Thai options who want to serve customers.</text></sentence><sentence id="223"><text>This gem never disappoints!  It is the perfect store to browse and giggle and pick up fun and/or lovely gifts for those hard to shop for people in your life... or the people in your life that have a wicked sense of humor.  

First, the books and magazines that greet you as you enter.  A fantastic collection of art and architecture coffee table books, some novels that are NYT best sellers, some fantastic journals and calendars.  There is usually a well behaved and very lazy dog lounging in this area as well.  From here you move into candles- YUM!- and picture frames, bath goodies and such, onto hialrious housewares, fabulous earrings and other jewelry, cute clutches, perfectly inappropriate cards, magnets, coasters, bottle openers... you name it!  Even cute and quirky baby and children gifts, which are sprinkled with a few gold standards.

You can literally knock out your entire Christmas shopping list here, from your gay boss to your ultra conservative mother-in-law, Paper Skyscraper has you covered.

Staff is adorable and super friendly.  Parking is a weebit of a pain.</text></sentence><sentence id="224"><text>Great produce for the best prices I have seen in Charlotte.  8 limes for a dollar?  Guess I'll be mixing mojitos tonight!  Avocado for .50?  Guess we'll be eating guac with our mojitos!  Basil, cilantro, mint?  Guess who is eating Thai tomorrow?  Plantains? I just watched Alton Brown make these, and at this price I cannot resist!

Aside from the produce and the ethnic foods and spices, I was surprised that the prices on the American brands (cereal, frozen foods, drinks, etc...) are much higher than the Teeter.

My five year old thought we had somehow beamed ourselves to another country.... She loved it!</text></sentence><sentence id="225"><text>This is a wonderful place to get lost in one lazy weekend day.  Their selection ranges from the weird and absurd to vintage and kitschy to antique, retro, funky cool.  Unfortunately, as of late, their selection has not turned over very quickly, is dull and uninspired and priced all over the map.  There were times when I could not leave without that breathless feeling of finding the perfect treasure you had no idea you needed until you saw it, the maze of aisles confusing me with treasures galore, all over the store and me not being to remember them all.  Not so at present.  I am hopeful that the Spring yard sales and Estate sales will breathe some life back into the long, winding aisles of the Sleepy.

I have come here for years.  I had a booth at their old location and at this location-- I love the hunt, the repurposing of goods, the uniqueness that only this type of place can bring into your home... I hope this is just a little bump in the road for us.  I was there-- in and out-- in under an hour this past Sunday (unheard of!).  And left without anything... not only did I leave with nothing, I left not seeing anything that I would buy if only I could... 

Free popcorn in the front and some of the nicest sales staff anywhere in Charlotte.  I will be back and will hopefully be able to re-review my once very faithful bazaar/homegoods/yard art store.</text></sentence><sentence id="226"><text>Falafel pitas, with hot sauce?  Delish!
Hummus?  Delish!
Tabbouleh?  Delish!
Babba ganoush?  Delish!

Service?  Outstanding!  (The owner loves children... has a gaggle of them himself.)

Price?  5 pitas, hummus, tabbouleh, baba ganoush, and a bag of pitas ~$25.00

The BEST picnic to-go in Charlotte.</text></sentence><sentence id="227"><text>Great dance instruction for children and teens.  I have one child currently taking tap and ballet here and one who took modern dance.  The quality of the instruction is great.  The recital is truly spectacular, held at Queens University, it is very exciting and professionally done. 

The studio itself is easy to access-- behind Park Road Shopping Center, and sells all the dance shoes, leotards, and tights they might need, at reasonable prices.  No running out to Morris Costume shop!

This studio is more pricey than the Y but the instruction is more technical and precise.  I have done both-- loved the Y but the convenience and the instruction at Jami Masters won me over.

They also do a monthly draft, so my scattered brain does not have to remember to pay monthly.</text></sentence><sentence id="228"><text>This place is HUGE and full of vendors who have a great eye for fantastic home furnishings and accessories.  TONS of glassware in right now... the new trend is the mid-century mod highball glasses, cocktail glasses and cocktail shakers-- they do not disappoint but they are a bit pricey compared to others I have been scoping out.

Great prices on some stuff, ridiculous prices on other things... this tends to be the case in these multi-vendor homegoods stores.  

I used to skip the upstairs as it usually was pretty boring but that area has really gotten gussied up and is worth a peek.  They have awesome art work in the stairwell and throughout the store.  Their signature candles smell wonderful!

The people who work here could not be any friendlier or more helpful.  

Surprise of the store:  They have really cute jewelry at affordable prices and have recently added cute scarves, as well!


4.5 stars but rounded down bcasue they still have a few vendors whose wares are not fitting for this place... seems like wasted space.</text></sentence><sentence id="229"><text>I have practiced here a lot.  Not because it is my favorite studio, it's not, but because of the convenience and because of Adam W., one of the instructors.  And Shana, my other favorite.  The classes are often very smelly, and I have had to leave when the odor is so overpowering that I was able to taste it in my mouth.  The hallway is crowded and annoying, both before class and after. Classes often are so crowded that you are touching your neighbor and getting their sweat drops onto your mat. eeek.

The crowd is definitely...interesting.  Lots of overzealous, scantily clad women who stay for more than one class in a row.  

This is not so much a yoga studio as much as a bootcamp-like atmosphere that uses yoga as the tool for your exercise.

Adam is the consistent exception to the bootcamp mentality.

I appear to have a masochist bone in my body because sometimes a good a--kicking as a workout suits me fine, but when I want yoga-- the exercise, the mindfulness, the spiritual component experience, I go elsewhere.

--They do offer a lot of karma classes, which is nice--
--their schedule works--</text></sentence><sentence id="230"><text>WIth a BOGO half-priced sale going on virtually anytime you arrive here, it is a bargain.  While their prices do seem to be slightly less than Dick's, the selection is minimal, and their kid's section is almost non-existent.  So, as great of a deal as one might find here, it is hard when there is not much merchandise to choose from.</text></sentence><sentence id="231"><text>I eat here every week for lunch with a lunch group (their choice, not mine).  The lunch menu is changed weekly and always includes Pad Thai and a curry dish (number 4).  All can be made vegetarian.

The lunch comes with a spring roll and soup.  I enjoy both.  My favorite meal is when number 4 is green curry with eggplant and green beans.  It is spicy- beware!

The service can be hit or miss but I can easily order, eat and pay within 50 minutes.  As a parent, I have gotten quite good at scarfing down a meal...

In the summer this restaurant is HOT.  And I don't mean hot as in crowded and covered with paparazzi, I mean they keep the AC at 78 degrees... sit in the main dining room rather than the sunnier side -room to keep from completely melting down- figuratively and literally.

Sadly, the food has declined in quality.  What was once a 4 star establishment is now a 3 star restaurant.  

Go get your curry on!</text></sentence><sentence id="232"><text>YUM!

Squash blossom hushpuppies followed by warm kale, fried goat cheese and beet salad, and a house made white bean burger with potaoes on the side.  Delish!  Loved sitting outside on the cute but small patio-- great people watching!  Love the cucumber water.

The veggie burger, while delicious, was way too big to eat as a burger.  The dipping sauce for the squash blossom hushpuppies was a bit disappointing.

Service was great.  Patio is cute; interior is small but quaint.</text></sentence><sentence id="233"><text>I am a salon girl but my stylist has always said that barbers are the best trained in their craft.  I took my four year old daughter here one afternoon after she insisted for hours that she wanted a haircut.  She went in with a hairstyle I would lovingly call 'bird's nest' and came out with an adorable and well done bob. She did not mind the no-frills atmosphere. There was a local anchorman and an elderly gentleman getting their hair did, too.  Old-school barber with friendly service at a great price... ($15 without tip) and a dumdum lollipop? Good stuff.

--we were walk-ins and did not wait but they did get busier while we were there with people who had appointments--</text></sentence><sentence id="234"><text>We have used tham a lot and they have never disappointed!  They take care of our deaf puppy, a big mutt dog, a bunny rabbit and 2 chickens for us.  They text us to tell us how everyone is doing and leave a lenghty note after each visit.  They also water plants and get our mail!

We have been thrilled with Little Friends!  They called this morning to tell us one of our chickens was missing (she wasn't, just has switched coops).  I appreciate their thoroughness and the attention they lavish on our pets.

Much less expensive than boarding, much happier animals, too!  They also have been wonderful at helping us "last minute" because, fortunately or unfortunately, that is how we roll sometimes...</text></sentence><sentence id="235"><text>I love this hidden gem which also happens to be the oldest farmer's market in Mecklenburg county.  It is full of locally grown delicious produce!  Heirloom tomatoes, big boys, hot house, purple Cherokees... you name it, they have it.  In addition to the corn, peppers, peaches, berries, eggplants, etc... they also have jams and local baked goods.  Lastly, the Beverly's Gourmet meals to go are divine!  Vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options available.  The tomato pie is fabulous!  These are great meals to drop off when you have signed up to bring a meal to a friend and cannot find the time for homemade... these meals are homemade, just not in your kitchen!

They take a debit card.

Located next to CMC-Main, park in rear.</text></sentence><sentence id="236"><text>Dr. Plonk is fabulous!  Seriously, if you are on the hunt for a pediatrician, he is truly amazing. Providence Pediatrics has moved since we started going to them, but our loyalty to Dr. Plonk is unwavering and I drive past several other pediatrics offices to get there (which, admit idly is a pain)... but, his kind bedside manner and his trust in a "mother's intuition", with his own dose of intuition has worked wonderfully for our family of three daughters.

He has called to check in on a very sick child, offering to work with our health care provider for in-home nursing care if we got too overwhelmed-- this all on a Saturday.  He called every day for a week to check on her (and us).  He has reassured a desperate mother that her unruly child was just "spirited" and "strong willed."  

His father was a country doctor and Dr. Plonk has that same genuine care and concern that I imagine (and have heard) that his father had.  

Unfortunately, we have had some medical bumps along the way and Dr. Plonk has helped us navigate through these tough times.  

Beth Haynes is also tremendous at this practice.

Dr. Plonk is 5-plus stars and their practice is, too.</text></sentence><sentence id="237"><text>I love Charlotte Yoga!  This is a friendly yoga studio without the pretense of some other studios.  The instructors are great-- Rowena, Angie and Jaime are my favorites.  And, when you go to a $5 class, not only are you getting a great class but also a great value!

The studio itself is clean, and has a lot of natural light streaming in from the floor to ceiling windows, which I like during my practice.  I feel a little claustrophobic in a hot studio that doesn't have windows.

The bathrooms are adequate (well the women's bathroom, did not check out the men's) with showers.  The hall does get crowded during class changes, but most studios have this issue.  They also have filtered water, fill up before you get into class!

The power classes that are offered after a hot class are little too hot, or I would give 5-stars.  Several times the classes that are advertised as "in an 85 degree room" have been in a 100 degree + room (I check the thermostat because I always wonder if something is wrong with me when my practice seems harder than normal!).  I have heard several people comment/complan about this issue.  Believe me, there is quite a difference between 85-87 degrees and 100 degrees!

This place is overflowing with friendly yogis.  My husband, who was really intimidated by the whole yoga thing, loves this place!  My top 2 studio in Charlotte.

--"Friend" them on Facebook for (occasional) coupons and discounts--</text></sentence><sentence id="238"><text>Unfortunately, my family has spent a fair amount of time here and we have always had a wonderful experience, although the wait, on occasion, is unbearable... but, if you show up with a toddler profusely bleeding while wearing a swimsuit (mother and daughter), mercifully, they usher you back pretty quickly.  They were hesitant to stitch up my daughter as the laceration was on her face, and they wanted a pediatric plastic surgeon to do it, but, as she had already had stitches in the EXACT same spot twice-- one of those times being at a clinic in a county that did not have a plastic surgeon, I assured them that plastic surgery to repair the scar was probably in her future, and asked them to sew her up .  They were compassionate and kind.  I appreciated it immensely!  They have diagnosed pneumonia, removed a bead from a nose, lacerated an infected toe, given breathing treatments for asthma, etc...</text></sentence><sentence id="239"><text>Our family of five got the Latin Combo-- full rotisserie chicken, fried plantains, salad, yucca, rice and beans.  All was delicious! The salad, topped with avocado and dressed with a tangy ( read mouthwatering) dressing was delicious! The plantains were perfect.  The rice and beans were fantastic.  Yucca dipped in the hot sauce... Divine!  My hubs and children devoured the chicken... Rave reviews- even from picky miss.  We had leftovers and, seriously, for a family of five to eat this delicious meal for a whopping $2600. almost made me feel guilty. Almost.

We also had the tostones and guacamole as an appetizer. Perfectly fried. Tons of well made guacamole.  We may have found our Sunday night supper spot!

Small interior. I would not bring really young or really loud children here.</text></sentence><sentence id="240"><text>Great Christmas trees and awesome horse drawn carriage ride to the barn!

This place is fantastic.  We have strawberry picked here, gone to the pumpkin patch, had a four-year old's birthday party here , ridden ponies, milked cows, gone on hay rides, made smores, and fed sheep and goats. 

These fine people have willed their land and farm to the Catawba Land Conservancy to preserve this lovely 50 acre farm.  It is now surrounded by McMansions but one can truly feel away from it all while here.

Easy drive, straight down Providence Road.

BTW-- the bday party was the best, most fun and affordable party we've done.  Strawberry pickin', kickball and a pinata.  Bliss!</text></sentence><sentence id="241"><text>What is not to love about half-priced wine on Wednesdays? 
 
I love the atmosphere here.  It is dark and sleek, very upscale.  The prices reflect that!

I have eaten dinner here before and while it was delicious, it was bit too pricey for what I received.  But, for a nice bar and some finger foods, this is the place!  The flat bread pizza with fig, arugula and prosciutto is perfect for sharing with a friend.  I am not a carnivore, so I remove the prosciutto from mine.  The crust is crispy, the figs are heaven!

The salads are also delicious-- the local heirloom salad is my favorite.  I love local foods, and this did not disappoint.


--They also have great draft beers--
--Napa Cellars Chardonnay on Wednesdays is $6/glass... can you say DEAL!?--
--The bar is quiet.  A great place to catch up with a friend, or to plot revenge on an ex-boyfriend (hers, not mine)
--The bathrooms are fantastic!  Love the faux crocodile floors!--
--Awesome outside seating--
--Park on the top-level of the parking deck that is attached to Southpark Mall, and it is an easy walk over... or valet--</text></sentence><sentence id="242"><text>Jeffre Scott Apothecary is a lovely little place full of luxurious lotions and potions, makeup and skincare products.  This would be enough to earn 5 stars but the real reason I gave JSA 5 stars is because of Jeffre and Charlton.  They could not be any friendlier.  And they knew exactly what I "needed" without me even knowing what I needed!  

What brought me in was the brow service... no wax or sugar or threading here (my sensitive skin says "thank you!") .  This service is 5 star worthy in and of itself.  

I think I just gave 15 stars?</text></sentence><sentence id="243"><text>Hands down this place offers the BEST children's swim lessons in Charlotte-- and I know because we have tried what seems like all of them!

The indoor pool area is great, with shower facilities and a locker room that are clean and a good temperature for freezing kids getting out of the pool.  The pool is an Olympic sized pool and is not kept freezing (like at MAC) but is cool enough for the children not to overheat.  The deep end has a ledge around the sides that the children can stand on while receiving instruction.  There are several diving blocks they practice on as well.  The seating is great... concrete bleacher-like seating that is in the pool area and divided by a smallish wall.  While the area does have a strong chlorine smell, it is nothing like other area YMCAs that have the indoor pools and water parks... my eyes do not sting while there nor do my clothes smell when we leave.  And, while it is warm in there (thank Goodness!), it is not sweltering.  The parking is awesome here.  There is never a crowd.

Ok, on to the instruction, which is great... I have enrolled a 4 year old and a 9 year old in this program.  My 4 year old could doggie paddle and swim just well enough to jump off the diving board, my 9 year old needed a refresher for the swim team and was mostly doing "illegal" strokes that would get her disqualified in a meet.  The lessons are at 6 week intervals, which is nice as really long-term commitments freak me out a bit (commitment phobe!).  They are so reasonably prices compared to what we have paid at the stand alone swim centers, I almost felt guilty.  This guilt increased when I found that my 9 year old was in a class with only one other child. The instructor was fantastic!  He pushed them enough to work hard but feel accomplished.  And he got her strokes totally straightened out (no more lifting her head to take a breath in freestyle).  We did 2 sessions (one 6 weeks, the other 5 weeks (even better for my commitment issues)), and my daughter ended up in the All Star swim meet after summer swim team.  Which was a bonus, I just did not want her to be embarrassed swimming.  The 4 year old?  After one 6 week session, she was doing a version of freestyle, jumping off the diving board and I felt totally safe letting her swim this summer without having to be in the pool with her at every moment.  

We will be there this Winter doing their little Winter league swim team.  Look for us, I will be the mom reading her book on the concrete bleachers and my daughters will be the ones splashing around and having a blast!</text></sentence><sentence id="244"><text>As a member of the Matilda Wong society, I felt compelled to review old faithful... 300 East.

I love the atmosphere.  Who can't be enamored with this old house in the heart of Dilworth?  I am not sure if she (the house) is considered a Grand Dame by historians and architects but it certainly is by me!  

I love sitting downstairs in one of the booths to the right of the hostess stand for a long leisurely lunch on a Saturday, that may, or may not, include a glass of wine.  I love coming here in the Fall and sitting outside, hearing the fountain and looking at the sheep statue.  I love coming here in the Winter and sitting in the really small and cozy booth in the main dining room.  Really, I cannot think of a time when it isn't right to come here!

The hummus plate is a delicious way to start your meal.  If you are lucky the white bean and gouda soup will be the daily soup offering.. it is bowl-licking good.  All the specials I have ever tried are delicious...  But, I tend to gravitate toward a salad or, my favorite, the black bean tortilla (with lots of fresh avacado!).  My hubbie likes the usual-- a grinder-ish type sandwich, the tuna, or whichever pasta is on the menu.

There is a special drink here called the "Matilda Wong"  and it is very, very wong.  It used to come in a smallish fishbowl (think beta fish) but is now served in a small pitcher.  When I say it is "wong", I mean it is strong, it is good for sharing but, plan on having a responsible driver.  They cut you off after 2, as they should.  I think I have aged out of the ability to even share one...

Nice wine list, half-priced wine nights.  This is a fun girls-night, or date night, or parents-are-in-town place.

This place never disappoints... lovely furnishings, lighting, art work, pillows, etc... it is pricey, so if you are looking for a deal, come during their semi-annual clearance sale- or check the back, where often there is sale merchandise.

They fabricate orders and offer design services.</text></sentence><sentence id="246"><text>My husband and I often stop in here to retox after we detox (look for us at the bar in yoga clothes, often still glistening with sweat).  The pretzel bites and the zucchini fries (more like sticks) are fantastic.  The dipping sauces are great!  The boom boom sauce is perfectly spicy... I wish I could recreate this at home. 

Dinner:  I did not enjoy my dinner.  Get the fried chicken.  My husband did enjoy his buffalo chicken sandwich.  I had some kind of salad-- obviously not a great choice in a bar but there veggie selection is limited-- it was not great but what is great is their brunch.  I prefer that to their dinner menu.  They also offer bottomless mimosas and bloody marys but-- good grief-- who can partake in that at noon on a Sunday?  Not me.  If you can, stop reading right now and say a prayer of thanksgiving.   The french toast, the omelet, the toast and grits, is all great.

They have a good beer selection on tap.  What they do not have is a good wine selection... this is definitely an area in which they can (and should) improve.  They have several specialty cocktails which usually are good.  There bloody marys are delish... especially the bloody martin.  

They have a cute little side room that you can reserve for parties. They have also been generous in the community, hosting fundraisers of various sorts.  Their marketing campaign-- Leroy Fox for President-- was awesome.  I loved seeing those signs in front yards.  "Free chicken for everyone."

This area needed this spot.  Hotel Charlotte had seen its better days... and the face lift and the thorough cleaning this spot got is great.  Even the restrooms aren't awful anymore.  I wish they had left the train running around the ceiling...

This is also a fun place to watch a game.</text></sentence><sentence id="247"><text>Tease Salon is awesome!  My hair has never looked better-- both cut and color.

You will thank me.   

Tucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.  

I was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to get the "what it is."  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!

While the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure.</text></sentence><sentence id="249"><text>I love the Neighborhood Theatre... it has kept me coming back for years.  From the Indigo Girls to DSO, the Brazilian Girls, North Mississippi Allstars, and Yo Mama's Big Fat Booty Band, to my most recent show-- the Blue Dogs and Drivin N Cryin, this is just a fantastic and friendly venue to see and hear a show.  

It gets loud and it can get crowded (very crowded) but it is usually a fun and friendly crowd.  On occasion you might want to get there early (bring a yard chair) if you want to grab a general admission seat (just put your name on the paper and pen you brought with you, and use the scotch tape you also remembered to bring) and reserve your seat... now head out to grab a bite while you wait for the show to start!  Seriously, it is that friendly... but, remember your seats won't allow for you to view the show, which is great for say, a husband who got dragged to see the IG.  

There are seats upstairs that are sometimes open, sometimes included in the GA price and sometimes reserved, just check the show listing.  There is also a VIP seating area that comes with a server.  I am fine to get my own PBR or-- the value cup!-- a big ole, in the case of this past weekend, Sierra Nevada.  Score!

Bathrooms surprisingly rarely have much of a wait... probably because you want to get in and out as fast as you can...but, they do have a Dyson hand dryer (the long one that you take your hands in and out of while hearing a sound similar to a jet engine!).  

This spot is a neighborhood staple and is an anchor to the area.  It is truly local business at its finest.  It also really helped ramp up the music scene in Charlotte...</text></sentence><sentence id="250"><text>I cannot believe I have not reviewed this bakery gem, this little slice of Heaven, the sugary wonder, my sweet and reliable Suarez Bakery.  

Cream Horns-- seriously, the flakiest pastry shell, sprinkled with powdered sugar and filled full of the lightest, fluffiest frosting-like fill.  

Snickerdoodles-- cinnamon sugar yuminess on top of an elephant ear like cookie/pastry.  

Elephant Ears-- a huge treat that is as large as a 5 year old's head (really).

Sugar cookies-- all shapes and decorations, perfectly sweetened to be able to eat several without feeling ill!  --- They also make these to order--- perfect for school parties that require cookies for decorating and the mom who does not bake!

Cupcakes-- all different flavors.  Delicious and lovely.

Cakes-- Tizzerts.  Need I say more?  Just the best cake you can put in your mouth... Our wedding cake was Tizzerts, and have had several other special occasion cakes from Tiz.

Thumb print cookies--  perfect for the little bit of sweet tooth, a small sugar cookie/ shortbread like cookie, topped with a smudge of frosting (this is my go-to treat).

I do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of my family.  So my go-to is the thumb print cookie but, even without a sweet tooth, the temptations of all this goodness cannot be resisted.   We celebrate milestones and accomplishments and hard days and completed projects by occasionally popping into Suarez and picking out a delectable treat.

He is very patient and thorough and just a really nice guy.  His staff was super helpful in helping me pick out glasses and training me on how to put in and remove contacts (which was awful but not their fault).  They also filed everything with my insurance company, which is great.

I also love that they call and email to remind of upcoming appointments.  I really appreciate this service.

They also have a location on Colony Rd., near the Lodge.

I am a person who hates going to any type of doctor.  They really make this a nice experience.</text></sentence><sentence id="252"><text>You never know what might be waiting at this consignment store-- a mirror, a chandelier (their selection is usually fabulous!), window treatments, or a lamp... who knows!?!

This is a consignment store and not a thrift store-- the prices reflect this.

Their inventory turns over quickly.  As a former client and a current customer, I can attest to that!

They can be a bit rude, or I would give 4-stars.  I do appreciate and expect friendly customer service as a consumer.

I have found some unique treasures here, so I continue to peruse!</text></sentence><sentence id="253"><text>This is the slooooooowest Starbucks service in town.  Due to the convenience of the location, I stop in here for a coffee on occassion but I have to have plenty of time on my hands in order to do so.

--parking is tight--</text></sentence><sentence id="254"><text>The patio gets 5-stars.  It is one of my favorites in Charlotte.  It has plenty of shade for eating brunch outside and it is a lovely setting on which to dine.  

I usually love their brunch but my food on Sunday was not good nor was our service.  I had the breakfast pita and I could not eat more than a bite of it, it just tasted really bad.  And this was weird based on the fact that some of my favorite foods had gon einto its preparation!  Spinach and cucumber sauce, egg and cheese and pita... should be delicious.  It was not.  

Our water and tea glasses were empty the entire meal, and we asked several times for refills to no avail.  

They do have excellent sangria and a nice wine list.  I guess I will stick to my standards:  fruit and granola for brunch, hummus and cheese plate for appies with wine.  

--the scones that are served before the brunch are divine--</text></sentence><sentence id="255"><text>What do you send to a mother who has decided to drive four 13 years olds and a 7 year old to Florida?  How about 4 huge bags of popcorn?  (Hey, it's not my car!)  A cheese, a carmel and 2 bags of butter should keep them busy for a little while, right?  

If you find yourself in need of popcorn for car trip or slumber party, movie night or school function, this is the place to get it.   

No need to call ahead for the aforementioned flavors.  They do have fancy flavors but you need to order in advance.

tip:  Skip the metal bucket and save $20 by having them put the bagged popcorn in a box.</text></sentence><sentence id="256"><text>As other reviewers have mentioned, the beer selection is great, but.... no Guinness on tap!?!  Isn't there a rule about this, somewhere?  That to be considered a bar with a good beer selection you have to have the real King-of-Beers on tap?  Out of a bottle does not do my Guinny any justice.  

The food is bar food but for a vegetarian, it is a terrible selection.  The salads are not good.  HUGE but not tasty.  My husband liked the wings just fine.  

Too many other places with beer selection and good food for this to my go-to bar.  Or to be a go-again bar.</text></sentence><sentence id="257"><text>The best massaman curry in town.  I get it with tofu.  My hubs likes the gang dang with chicken.  

Wonderful tea.  Wonderful service.

I love this cozy place in the winter... it is so endearingly ecclectic on the inside: it is small but not tight, it has a great window onto the sidewalk of East Blvd., it has twinkly lights around said window.  Walking in here from the cold, sitting down to a hot pot of tea and some massaman is a great way to spend a lunch hour but an even better way to spend an evening.

--the parking is tight--</text></sentence><sentence id="258"><text>OK, the atmosphere is fun and festive.  Who does not like colored lights strewn about and awesome old rock band posters on the walls?  The floors were clean and the bar area was fun... a great place to meet a friend for a canned beer.  Yes, really.  And with a gut washer choice of one chardonnay, you will drink the canned beer.  Or the draft beer- but beware, the Shiner Bock was flat and not very cold. Disappointed, party of one.  Ok, Ok... so, you might enjoy a fun atmosphere on a great street to meet friends for... drinks.  But not dinner.

I had the fried avocado tacos and the black eyed pea salad.  Both were bad.  The bean salad, and I love stuff like this, was swimming in salt and vinegar.  I think those were the only ingredients.  It was bad.  The fried avocado tacos (as a vegetarian this prospect sounded delicious to me!) were, ummm, tasteless. Which might be better than the black bean salad which might have benefited from being tasteless?  The queso was good.  But, seriously, who can't melt some cheese?  

I like food too much to return here.</text></sentence><sentence id="259"><text>I love this precious little spot.  Birds, and turtles, owls, snakes, frogs, butterflies... what is not to love?

They will get the snakes out on request for you (or in my case, my children) to hold.  They will also get the skunk out!  Apparently, they are a lot like cats-- and I must admit, my curiosity got the best of me and I did find myself stroking the coarse hair of the injured animal.  The butterfly garden is a wonder!  We also found turtles hidden in there.  My younger (5 y/o) loves the puppet shows.

The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable! 

The little play area gets crowded and lots of inattentive mothers can create quite a bit of mayhem... we usually skip this area.

Bring sanitizer, as little hands seem to find their way into the turtle water.  Eeek!

Once we are finished here, we walk on the nature trail to Freedom Park for picnic fun and play time!  We usually look for the grumpy old troll who lives uinder the bridge, as we cross into the park.

This is a great way to spend the day!</text></sentence><sentence id="260"><text>The best beef kebab EVER!! The meat is so tender and juicey - just be careful not to touch the bottom of the metal skewer when it arrives - it's super hot. Make sure to also order the garlic sauce and red meat sauce for dipping. It's a warm atmosphere with a very friendly staff. I've gotten many friends hooked on this place. 5/5.</text></sentence><sentence id="261"><text>Extremely disappointing.

This place had been on my To-Try list for a while now. I came with three friends on a Saturday night when it was not too busy. I ordered the beef ribs ($16.50) with a side of potato salad ($4.00). My friends ordered the pork ribs ($16.00), along with a few appetizers.

What bothered me about the service was that they just sort of drop the food off at the table to no one in particular. Ideally, the server should place the dish in front of the specific person who ordered it, or at the very least ask, "Okay who ordered the so-and-so?" and place it in front of whoever answers. Also, delivery should be simultaneous. Two of my friends got their dish, and me and the fourth friend waited 15 minutes after that for ours.

For $16.50, I received TWO beef ribs with barely any meat on them. In my opinion, ribs should be fall-off-the-bone. These were the exact opposite, and the flavour was nothing special. My friend was even more disappointed with his pork ribs, and sent them back in exchange for the pulled-pork sandwich.

First time in a very long while where I tipped less than 15%.</text></sentence><sentence id="262"><text>Ridiculous! The hostess seat us down with a major attitude because we asked to seat on a booth. She throw the menu down on the table, and did not speak a word to us. After that we waited 20 mins for a server to come to us. The services there was absolutely terrible! If you want your night ruined, then go there. The food was cold when it came out.</text></sentence><sentence id="263"><text>Brio is always a happy dining experience.  For this specific location, I've only been for happy hour, but I don't see how their regular menu would differ from their location at Town Square.  

Their happy hour must be one of the best!  They have a list of items for $2.95.  Don't let the price fool you though.  Their portions are decent sized.  We always order one of everything, and maybe even two of some other things.  (Don't judge us!!)  How could you not though?  Cheap, good food is so hard to pass up!

Their service is always amazing.  They check several times to make sure everything is okay and refill drinks before it is necessary.</text></sentence><sentence id="264"><text>A couple girl friends and I ventured over for lunch on our break between classes.  One of the girls heard from some of her friends that this place was "soooo good".  Well, these friends of hers have either really low standards or just don't know the difference between good, quality food and junk.

All of us ordered the shoyu ribs ramen.  To say that it was disappointing would be an understatement.  The soup was luke-warm at best and it tasted almost sweet.  Ramen is supposed to be savory, so the sweet-ish soup was a major no-no.  The noodles were also sad.  It tasted like the instant stuff.  Gross.  Supposedly, their other menu items (i.e. gogi beef stuffed waffles) are supposed to be better, but that is a chance that I am not willing to take.

Their decorations/furnishings were quite interesting.  The first thing we noticed upon walking in was their Transformer-like chairs.  They had some anime characters painted on the wall and had some anime show/movie playing silently on a tv.  The place was insanely dark that we were blinded when we were walking outside to leave.  

It goes without saying that I definitely will not be going back.  I much rather eat Panda Express on campus.</text></sentence><sentence id="265"><text>Five Guys FTW!!  This place is pretty amaaaa-ZING! 

We usually get the bacon cheeseburger (I order the "little" since two patties on the "regular" would be too much for me).  I love the FREE toppings you get which include grilled mushrooms and onions.  I always  order mine with extra mushrooms as I am a mushroom feign.  They also pile on the bacon which is awesome since most places gimp you on that.  Their bacon cheese dog is also delicious.  I just wish they had sport peppers.  Oh well, you can't win them all.  

Their cajun fries are also a must!  I'm not a big french fry fan (especially the thick cut kind), but the fries here are to die for!  The cajun fries are extra addicting (which is probably why they have such generous portions).  

This place does not fail to disappoint and has grown to be our go-to place for burgers.</text></sentence><sentence id="266"><text>This used to be our "go to" for buffets.  The boyfriend and I decided to try it out when they first opened, and found that we enjoyed the pre-divided portions.  (Mind you, not everything was like that.  There were also food served the traditional buffet way.)  Apparently, you either love this particular serving style or you hate it.  We loved it.  Food and service quality were definitely up to par.  They have a variety of food and have choices available that aren't your typical buffet fare.  They also have a mac and cheese bar, which I loved since I am a mac and cheese feign.  I think the thing I enjoyed most was the desserts.  I'm not a big sweets person so I chose the French macaroons and the white chocolate dipped crab apples and strawberries.  However, for the people with a sweet tooth, they have a variety of gelato, fudge, cakes, and whatever else.  

Unfortunately, we've heard that the food isn't the same as it was before so we haven't been back.  They also raised their prices (it used to be $29, I think).  It's now $35, which is a bit steep if I'm not guaranteed amazing food.</text></sentence><sentence id="267"><text>I grew up in Glendale and I have always loved Cerreta's candy. I think the Cerreta family has put a lot of thought into the variety of their product offering and to ensure the highest quality of their ingredients. I feel that the candy itself is a testament to another time, the shape, size and taste transports me back to a time even before my youth.  I time I never knew but always imagined as better somehow.

Even though some of the presentation of the products and d&#233;cor may seem dated, I sincerely feel that it is all part of the charm of this family owned business. I now live on the east coast, and try to swing by the store whenever I am in town to grab a box of French Mints for my office and get a few free samples while I'm there. It's always a hit with my co-workers. 

I also like picking up the individually wrapped candies, from time to time.  I find the factory store to have much more variety than the grocery store chains that also carry Cerreta's products around town. I have found this location to have a few more modern candy offerings, such as peanut butter truffle and mint cookie crumble. Everything is excellent here and if you are in the area, you should swing by. Life is short, what are you waiting for?</text></sentence><sentence id="268"><text>I grew up in Glendale and my parents would have Friday Pizza night, where we would get take out from Pullano's. I now live within proximity of Manhattan and have access to really great pizza. I try to swing by Pullano's when I am back in town, and I have to say that that the pizza still holds up after all of this time. It's nothing like the New York style pizza, but it's always really good. They have a thick crust, with a house made tomato sauce (that at times can be on the sweet side). They have a tendency to overdo it with the cheese but it still comes together well. I think it's a testament to the fresh ingredients. Overall, the menu is expansive and does not disappoint. See you guys next time I am in town!</text></sentence><sentence id="269"><text>Anyone looking to have their yard landscaped by this company WATCH OUT!!!

They advertise the bar stays open till 12am but in our whole stay when we arrived back after dinner, usually before 11pm,  the place was all locked up.

Ok next night gets even better we arrive back at 10.30 and guess what ... bar closed. No problem we order drinks in our room and they send us Macaroni and Cheese!

All this for a mere $400 a night!</text></sentence><sentence id="272"><text>It was horrible, the soup tasted like it came from a can. You can tell it's frozen food.

Lettuce a little brown, rolls very out of bag from store feeling.  Many things lacked flavor when the creative names and combos made me expect something bold.  I'm not sure what some of the yelpers liked so much ?  The snickers pie was blah.  My salad was plain.  My wifes quiche was like a frozen pot pie. I liked my app, but not so much I'd order it twice.  The only thing we like was our butter finger shake, but madison has a few thousand places to get custard.  Our server was nice and helpful, but lacked courage in guiding our selection.

I left and went back to eat my food with no resolution to the issue.  Then the front desk girl brought out the carbon copy and told me why I was wrong while my two year old is having a meltdown.

The space and view is excellent.  Great vibe and view.  The problems started with my order.   I ordered the quiche of the day and sat down.   15 min pass and they came to my table and said they were out of what I ordered.   I switched to what's left, no problem.  Another 15 min passed and I went to the front and they told me it was a very busy day and that it was almost ready.  (It was less busy than an average lunch rush at most places I have been in town.) When I finally got the quiche it was cold and blah.   I hope to try again and experience what everyone is talking about.  It stands on 3 stars for being a cool hang out.</text></sentence><sentence id="309"><text>Good local shop.

I expected one of the cats to still have shedding, however the other cat  gets groomed regularly. I noticed that they were using furminstors which I have been told isn't good for cats because it just pulls out more hair. I got home and brushed my normally groomed cat and I've never seen her so bad. I think they just pulled out the hair without trying to brush it out. I'm unfortunately disappointed. I will be going back to Petsmart. They did have a challenge with the other cat however because of the amount of hair. She looked like a different cat when finished. However in the past taking my other cat to get groomed I can pet her without getting lumps of hair or not seeing loose hair.</text></sentence><sentence id="315"><text>If I could give negative stars I would.  Their pizza is not that great, go get yourself a five dollar pizza for better taste.  They mess up your order, and when you go to call to get it fixed they tell you, "I really don't care sweetheart."  Don't waste your time unless you like shitty food and liked being insulted with it at the same time.</text></sentence><sentence id="316"><text>I absolutely love this place!  By far the best salon I've ever been to!  Yes it's pricey, but they disclose all the charges to you before they start their work.  I've been screwed over multiple times by hair salons, but they are very honest upfront about their prices.  I spent a lot on my hair, but I was also box dying it for several months which they had to correct, and I didn't have a hair cut in six month prior to coming here.  Jenn did my hair, and she did an excellent job.  Some may not like that there were passed off to different people, but I didn't mind it at all, it gets things done much faster.  The essentials are done by the person you are originally set up with.  I bought a lot of product, which I was given an awesome discount on, and Jenn put some of the red hair dye in my conditioner while sending me home with gloves as well!  I don't care what anyone else says, I would totally recommend this place!</text></sentence><sentence id="317"><text>Decent place to go, only reason I give it five stars is because of the prices.

I subtracted a star for the attitude I received from the servers.  One however was extremely nice and made sure my cups were always full.

We walk in, I wanted to sit in the back, and the woman who seated us had us sit where an employee was eating and kicked her out of the seat...right in front of us.  I felt extremely uncomfortable and felt bad.  Then as we sit down, a man came out and said something to the waitress and looked at us and said, "You took my table."  I almost wanted to walk right then and there and say, "Oh okay, here is your table, we'll go where they welcome their fucking customers."  ...but didn't.  I told the woman, that we could sit at the table next to us and not have anyone moved or their table "taken".  Her response? "We need that for the bigger parties."  That table remained unoccupied the entire time we were there.

If their prices weren't cheep and the sushi wasn't decent I wouldn't have been back. :/</text></sentence><sentence id="318"><text>I'm not sure why there are so many negative comments, I had a good experience here.  The main reason I tried this place is because of the location, only being about 5 minutes away from my house.  Christina did my nails, extremely helpful and nice.  She took her time to get me the the exact color I wanted, talked to me and offered me a drink.  I went in an hour before closing and the receptionist was afraid I wouldn't be able to squeeze in a pedicure, but Christina was fast and efficient to make sure I had enough time.  Another woman (I forgot her name :( ) did my pedicure when everyone was already packed up and ready to leave so I really appreciated that.  It seriously was the best pedicure I've ever had, all the tough skin I had on my feet gone.  A lot of people complain about the laziness of the owner, but I didn't see him fooling around.  A nail lady's phone was going off and he was attentive to put her ringer on silent, and sorting through the receipts with the receptionist. 

Only downside...the owner of the place was there today, and a bit standoffish.  I wouldn't say rude...but not friendly.  He interrupted my pedicure to have the lady check a yelp review (I'm assuming) because it was regarding a complaint and it was in a different language she could understand.  I didn't mind but it seemed unprofessional.  He kind of was staring at me, so I just said hello and he ignored me. :/ I would have given it five stars.  However, I work in an office, and a lot of ladies ask about my nails since I'm constantly working with my hands, and I will recommend this place and Christina!</text></sentence><sentence id="319"><text>If there was an option to give this place negative stars, I would.  First of all, you walk in and even in the dining area wreaks of smoke.  So you push that aside thinking your steak will be good enough to bare the smell.  Nope, ordered a medium rare, still tough as nails.  I ordered ONE drink, the same exact drink I ordered at Tex Mex down the street, a smaller portion for literally double the price.  Tex Mex $5.00, this place $10.00 for a vodka and seven up in a smaller glass.  Then, I asked for a side of ranch, charged me for it.  This place is ridiculous.  What are you? Gorden Ramsy Steakhouse?  Get out of here, your food sucks so don't charge me extra for ranch to try and get the leather tasteless steak out of my mouth.</text></sentence><sentence id="320"><text>Best vet ever! We drive all the way from mountains edge just to update our cats on their vaccines because we only trust him!!!</text></sentence><sentence id="321"><text>If you want your ice cream served by rude bitches, by all means, go here.  I went in with my fiance and friend after eating at the Thai restaurant a few feet away.  The three of us walk in, my fiance wanted a peanut butter shake.  "We don't have peanut butter ice cream, but we can put peanut butter in the shake, what kind of ice cream do you want?" He ordered the chocolate malt ice cream.  Then I order, then my friend goes to order, and as Sammy the "leader on duty" walks out my friend goes to tell her what he wants, but instead is told, "Oh she'll help you when she's done." and helps the person after him.  I don't know, maybe I'm not sure how a line is formed and serviced, but I thought it was on a first come first serve basis, but apparently at Cold Stone, it's every OTHER person in line...who knew?  Anyway, my fiance goes to try his shake, and low and behold...no peanut butter.  He goes to the register and just simply asks, "Can you add peanut butter to my shake?"  Sammy looks at the ice cream scooper who took our order and asks, "Did he ask for peanut butter?" ....she says no.  Seriously little girl?  We were all there, we had a discussion about not having peanut butter ice cream...how can you try and manage this lie?  So as I'm explaining to this girl to try and refresh her memory about our order...Sammy rudely interrupts and says, "Well it's going to cost more to add peanut butter."  We all just looked at each other shocked and the girl who took our order stated, "My bad." as if she really thought that was a proper apology.  Wow.  So we all walked out.

 I will not be coming here again, just because I'm worried for MY well being.  I wanted to throw my fiance's shake at Sammy aka leader on duty's head for being such a rude brat.  If they were a little bit nicer, and actually acted like they cared because I don't know...that's your job working in customer service...I wouldn't be so bitter about it.  If any of you ladies are reading this, please remember you aren't going to get too far with that kind of attitude with anything you do in your career. :/</text></sentence><sentence id="322"><text>I've been waiting for Live Market to open for a while. From the moment I saw the familiar "Live" sign appear in Liberty Village, I've been waiting. They opened in the week I was out of town visiting family, so for a week, I watched from a far, watching my friends post pictures of the various things they had bought, and ate,  looking forward to being back in my hood of Liberty/Niagara so I too could eat this stuff too.

Live Market is conveniently(?) located right near my gym, so I have been here three times in a fairly short time period, and it's nice to have such a great post-workout option, and really extra nice to have a close non-starbucks coffee/tea option near my house.

Both times I've actually ordered food, it's been very very tasty. First time - the chickpea burger, second time, upon the recommendation of the server - Burdock Burrito (Do order this. It is yummy.) Live Market also keeps me in Silk Road earl grey tea. I've had the wherewithal to arrive shortly before the influx of Liberty Village work folks coming in on their lunch break.

I often feel like the best way to tell the service level of a restaurant is how they handle minor errors. My partner ordered and ended up waiting a fairly long time for his lunch order, so not only did they make it right, they apologized, and offered him a coffee for his trouble. Smooth. Empowered staff make me a happy camper, so we just left liking them even more.

They've got Ezra Pound roasted coffee, and prepared ready-to-go items, juices, snacks, and treats, as well as order-in items if you have a little more time. 

There are lots of locally made products like ChocoSol chocolate, Stasis Preserves, Bunner's Cookies, Sweets from the Earth treats, amongst other things. You can buy protein powder, tea, coffee, and even make up. They also have jars of Rawtella for sale, which I wouldn't call "healthy", but I would call really really delicious (since I did end up buying some on my last visit...)

Service has been consistently friendly, food has been consistently good, and I feel like I get good value for my money when I go there.

Things to know: They don't have debit/credit working yet, but it's coming soon. I.E., At the moment it's Cash Only.</text></sentence><sentence id="323"><text>Like most Veg-o's I was a little sad when Fressen announced they were closing. Not because I particularly liked it, but because it was the main option for a slightly fancier totally vegan night out, with wine (the other tasty option being Vegetarian Haven, without wine.)

A group of 7 of us went on their second day. Is it too early to do a review? Maybe. So take it all with a grain of salt. I hear things are still "evolving" and the menu might change. More desserts might appear. Anything could happen. 

The Bar Snax menu looks interesting, and the idea of being able to have drinks and vegan snacks at midnight or 1 am, is promising, especially with Bar Chef next door (which has zero veganizable food options at all according to the last time we went...)

The Grasslands interior and drink menu is the biggest change when compared with Fressen. And those are really nice improvements. It's brighter, while still being intimate, and has a more open feel, with less cramped seating. 

Another pleasant change is that the servers all seem friendly, and generally helpful.

Food is very Fressen-like, so if you liked Fressen, you will like Grasslands. I had a favourite go-to dish at Fressen.  I ordered the skewer and liked it. Everyone else ordered the seitan roast or the chicken. Bar Snax menu is the biggest change from the former, and it's full of crispy and bite sized options.

Major problem on our first visit was that we went in a group of 7, which means an automatic gratuity of 18% was added to our bill. But there was nothing on the menu to indicate this, the person taking our reservation didn't let us know, and the servers didn't mention it. Since we're decent people, we obviously added a tip, and so, double tipped. Womp womp.

I'll leave out the Facebook page drama that ensued after we commented about it on their page, but regardless, they did not handle the comments well, and shut off posting on their page entirely. Hopefully it was an educational experience.

To sum it up: Food is okay. Service is good. Bar (and associated menu) is great. Interior is great.</text></sentence><sentence id="324"><text>Since this place is one of the Indie Coffee Passport stops, I skipped buying my typical latte and ordered a (vegan) soup instead. I asked the server if the bread that came with it was vegan too, and he said he didn't think so. 

Now, this is the part I really liked. He quietly gave me a bit of a discount on the soup (which is normally 3.95) I thought that was a nice (and unexpected) touch. He was very friendly in general, and asked me how my soup was when he walked by later. 

I wish they got their vegan baked goods from somewhere other than "OMG Baked Goodness" because I can't support that place at all. Please get some Sweets From the Earth!

It's got free wifi (yey!)
It charges extra for soy milk (booo!)

The soup was decent, the first bite was kind of oddly sharp and unpleasant, but by the end of it I was really enjoying it, so I think I'd probably order it again.</text></sentence><sentence id="325"><text>Today I successfully made a pillowcase. I'm so proud I had to tell Yelp. But seriously, I love this little store, and I'm sad that it took me so long to visit, but I anticipate visiting more frequently in the future.

I took the Basic Sewing Essentials class on a whim, and now I can't wait to take more. The classes are small (just 6 people) and easy to follow. The instructor was helpful, with good advice on troubleshooting machine problems, threading issues, and other sewing machine stuff. I left feeling like I had learned something that I could actually do again without  being confused. Karyn, the owner, was our instructor and came around regularly to check on everyone and offer help or advice.

There is a store dog, and initially, that was weird, but in a good way. I usually don't like dogs, but this one is laid back, friendly (but not too friendly) and spent most of her time on the couch in the back. 

The fabric selection is awesome. So many different colours and textures. They have fat quarters in various styles and colours, notions, patterns, and other supplies.

Really positive experience, and I would recommend it if you're looking for fabric, or if you're looking to start taking sewing classes.</text></sentence><sentence id="326"><text>Their "Vegan Delight" wrap has Havarti cheese in it? You suck Itz A Wrap. Will not return. Ever. And apparently they've had the sign up since at least last year?

I'd give it no stars, but it's not an option.</text></sentence><sentence id="327"><text>I ordered a soy latte and it was PERFECT. Just a perfect cup, the flavour was so smooth and delicious. I walked in mid barista banter, which was pretty entertaining, and while the space is really small, I managed to come in when it wasn't too busy and got a seat.

I really want to try the siphon coffee sometime.</text></sentence><sentence id="328"><text>I dropped into this wine bar for.... surprise.... a glass of wine. I had checked out their menu online earlier but opted not to order anything solid. Though they do have a couple of small veganish options.

Eight has a modern decor, good atmosphere, and while I was there, a live DJ. There were television screens in the wall playing oh so hipply distorted Alfred Hitchcock movies.

When I walked in it was mostly empty, the bartender was friendly, and the service reached that delicate balance of attentive but unobtrusive. 

I ordered a terrible wine, the name of which I have forgotten, but that's not their fault. I picked something local and cheap. They have a great wine list, available by the glass or by the bottle, so you're bound to find something to enjoy.

The server was kind enough to keep offering to fill up my glass of water at least 5 times after I finished that 1 glass of (terrible) wine. They weren't exactly busy, but there wasn't a moment I felt rushed out of there and it was appreciated.</text></sentence><sentence id="329"><text>The first time Merchants of Green coffee was recommended by a barista at another coffee shop, I put it on my mental To Visit list. She had mentioned that it didn't look like a place you could go inside and drink coffee, so I was slightly more prepared for the remote location, but I still got lost on the way.

Unfortunately the day I went in, they had run out of regular soy milk, and considering I've been ordering a soy latte from everywhere... that was a bit of a disappointment. They don't have soy milk, so one of the barista's happily suggested 2%. I'm not sure how that's an equivalent option, but (obviously) I didn't go for it.

Luckily there was someone else there, and he offered me a very awesome tasty latte made with So Nice soy creamer (which is a lot thicker than regular soymilk). He warned me it might be too sweet. But no, it was delicious and a great cozy cup of coffee (and now I kind of wish people always made me lattes with that heavy soy creamer...).

Wandering through their location is a bit like visiting a mini coffee museum.

I'd like to go back again and try just a regular coffee from Merchants of Green Coffee or take one of their coffee workshops after I've completed the rest of my Indie Coffee Passport Stops.</text></sentence><sentence id="330"><text>I had a great experience at the Wind store today.

Honestly, the store was a madhouse when I got in. There were over a dozen customers inside and 4-5 customer service agents in the store.

But, I waited only around five minutes to talk to someone, and in a little over 15 minutes I was set up with a new account, with the plan I wanted (at 50% off for 6 months) and a new phone (on WindTab). 

Daniel S was super helpful, gave me all the pertinent info I needed, answered my questions, and hooked me up with a phone number I might actually be able to remember. Everyone working in there seemed friendly and approachable, so that's a plus.

That is what customer service should be like. 

Overall, I was really satisfied with the customer service I recieved, and so far the coverage has not been an issue (for me). I haven't seen "Wind AWAY" at all yet. Surprisingly enough, I can use my new phone in places I couldn't use my Rogers phone (like... the elevator in my office building...)</text></sentence><sentence id="331"><text>Once upon a time we came here for a birthday party. There were around ten of us, and we'd reserved a space.

Music seemed subtle enough, and I liked their selection of drinks and vodkas. Staff was polite and friendly, but it was difficult to actually order as we were left alone for long stretches of time. 

Most drinks were delicious, some were total flops, at least for my palate - if we come back here again, I'll be sure not to feel too experimental.</text></sentence><sentence id="332"><text>I guess I'm not excited about this place because for me, it not only has limited options, it doesn't actually have a good option. The "Juicy Vegan" is one of the most expensive items on their menu, and when I ordered it, the woman at the counter asked me if I want sour cream or cheese. And I ask... well is it vegan sour cream or cheese? to which she replies "no it's not included" (???) 

Dear restaurants, if you have something labelled "vegan" on the menu, could you let your staff know what "vegan" actually means? Thank you.

We waited about 20 minutes to get our orders. After I picked out the big tasteless spears of tofu out of my not so juicy  "Juicy Vegan" it wasn't so bad. I liked the diversity of vegetables, it was an ok size, but I'd probably opt for Big Fat Burrito or Burrito Boyz instead of going to this place again.

My friend ordered the special of the day which was a Korean BBQ burrito and his reaction was equally meh. 

I wanted to like them, because I love burritos and I'm nearly always in the village, but it just didn't happen.</text></sentence><sentence id="333"><text>Like the Crema Coffee Co. on Bloor, the soy latte I ordered from here was delicious. Though if you're expecting coffee art, you might not get it. I certainly didn't, but luckily that doesn't really matter much to me.

They baristas are friendly, helpful, and competent, and when I bought an Indie Coffee Passport here, one of them had a few suggestions for other places on the list to visit (which was extremely helpful, and I'm looking forward to taking advantage of her coffee wisdom.)

There are adequate outlets (well... okay there are six, and I got one, so for me, that's adequate)  for us computer folks, fast free wifi and places to sit. I noticed one gluten free/vegan option in the collection of sweet baked goods at the counter, hopefully they improve the selection on that front. Though people looking for gluten free or vegan baked yumminess with their coffee can just cross the street like I did, and grab something from Bunner's Bake Shop. 

My only complaint is that they normally charge extra for soy milk, but I avoided that issue by using the indie coffee passport.</text></sentence><sentence id="334"><text>I finally went to King's Cafe after it was recommended to me by a lot of other people.

I had sampled some of their very delicious appetizers at the Vegetarian Food Fair last month, so I was excited to try an entree. Well... I had the Soy Fritters with Curry Rice, and I don't know if it was just the wrong dish to order or what, but I didn't think it was very good. Fried tofu gluten fritters with carrots, potatoes, beans and cauliflower sounded so yummy but it wasn't.

The only thing I really enjoyed the flavour of was the potatoes, because they seemed to have taken on the most of the curry flavour, the veggies and soy/gluten stuff weren't very flavourful. I needed some hot sauce for sure.

At least it was on the Special Order menu so it was only 5.99, some of the other items were 10-13.

They also wouldn't let me plug in my laptop and were generally kindof rude. so, eh. Not very enthused.</text></sentence><sentence id="335"><text>You know, it's been two years since my first review of this place, and often, places start strong and then fizzle a little, sometimes I expect that quality will go down, or the atmosphere might change. Not this place.

I straight up love Boreal Gelato. They have vegan-friendly gelato in interesting flavours, today they had chocolate, salted caramel, and coconut. Fruit based  sorbettos are great and all, but these were extra exceptional, creamy, rich, and just all around delicious. 

I know flavours rotate, but I haven't yet tried any flavour of their non-dairy gelatos that wasn't tasty.

There is ample seating, inside and a little area outside to sit on, service was quick and friendly, 

Go there.</text></sentence><sentence id="336"><text>I've been going to the Depanneur nearly once a week for a few months. They have a casual atmosphere, and are generally a good venue to find local food stuffs. Corner store by day, dinner establishment by (some) nights, it's really a great space.

The drop-in dinners are usually why we end up there once a week (or more) whenever they have a vegan one (which is on the regular.) It's always something different, but it has been consistently delicious. The chef stylings of Len (who I think is the owner) cooking something up every Tuesday, Emily Z, or Kalmplex (and many others) make this place just a total hidden gem (that I kind of don't want to tell anyone about, because I want to keep it to myself.)

As people have mentioned, sign up for the newsletter on their website (or connect with them on facebook/twitter) to keep up with the events they have going on, there is always something for everyone. 

The house made sodas are totally delicious (elderberry, blackcurrent, maple lemonade, just to name a few), they also have coffee/tea, apple cider, and soy milks. 

Packaged foods include local mushrooms, jams and jellies, ketchup made in house, and freshly baked buns and breads (often with gluten-free options as well), soups, milks, yogurts, and other small business produced products.

There is WiFi, there is table space, and the service is always friendly. It's like a home cooked meal in the best possible way.

Things to know: CASH ONLY (there is an ATM available at the convenience store across the street)</text></sentence><sentence id="337"><text>I love this little place off Church.

This place has  three varieties of sorbetto that are vegan and DELICIOUS. I love getting a scoop of mango and a scoop of the lemon (the lemon is amazing.) Sure variety is limited, but what they do have is fantastic.

The service has been consistently friendly every-time (and there have been many times) I've gone in with friends. The interior looks great, and it's nice to be able to sit out on the patio if it's decent out.

Plus they have a beautiful selection of chocolate (That I've never tried, but it looks great.)</text></sentence><sentence id="338"><text>I loved this hotel. High ceilings, and a spacious, stylish room. I kept telling my partner... I like this... I like this... and then this.

Clean lines, hyper modern rooms with a split shower, where, if an interested party wanted to voyeristically watch you bathe, they could do so, while laying on a very comfortable bed. And if you aren't so keen on goose down, they have alternate bedding available upon request.

The service was stellar. More towels? 5 minutes you're swimming in towels. You want a ride to the train? Here is our fancy Audi we'll take you over. You want free wifi? Here you go. You want to come back to a room with a bottle of ice wine, soft music and lit up by little floating candles? No problem.

The included "continental breakfast" wasn't bad either. Not the vegan friendliest of places obviously, but they had fruit, coffee jams, peanut butter, and DIY toast your own bread station. They have almond milk sometimes,  but not during the time we were there, but I appreciated that the server tried to hunt some down for me.

I loved all the little details.  I also loved how close it was to the Metro and bixi stands, art galleries, and copious amounts of patios.</text></sentence><sentence id="339"><text>I had a terrible latte here. Bitter, weak foam, and unexciting. Maybe it was a bad day to go in, since I walked in on Boxing Day, and it was one of the only open cafes. I might give it a do over after I'm done with the rest of my Indie Coffee Passport stops, but I'm not in any rush.

I enjoyed the space itself though, that wide open emptiness. My table was covered in magazines (so if you don't bring reading material, you're more than covered), they have wifi and I read and finished a book without interruption (it's quiet). I'd probably go back eventually, buy a coffee I might not even like, solely to hang around. Maybe that's why there isn't much seating, there is a certain dark homey comfort to this place I can't quite put my finger on, but I like it.

While I'm happy they offer soy AND almond milk, I don't like that they charge extra for it.</text></sentence><sentence id="340"><text>I went for my first ever float yesterday evening and I really liked it. Staff at Float were super friendly and helpful, and offered me a nice peach tea while I waited for my turn to go in. It was very relaxing.

I've been getting a few questions about the process so I figured it would be helpful to have some idea of what happens when you walk in.

So this is what happens when you walk in.

I had already paid and made my appointment online, so I just walked in around 15 minutes before my appointment. I signed a release form, drank some tea, and waited until my turn came. A friendly member of the staff showed me to the room I would be using, explained a bit about the tank, and some advice on ear plugs, then he left me alone to do my thing. 

The doors lock, so you have some privacy.

I had the last float of the night, so it was 2 hours long, but standard floats during the day are around 1 hour.  They have 5 rooms, each with flotation tanks in them, and it's easy to make an appointment online, which was a major plus.

Each room has a shower, a bench, and a flotation tank, and a robe. Towels &amp; ear plugs are also provided. They have scent pre-float shampoo &amp; body wash you can use to get ready before going into the tank, and a more scented post-float shampoo and conditioner.

The flotation tank has about 10 inches of water, and a whole bunch of dissolved salts (for max float potential), so it's easy to get into the tank, sit on the bottom, close the door, lay in the water, and then open it again, or whatever you feel comfortable with. 

At first I was a little anxious about getting lost into the abyss of the tank, and it just seemed to get darker, but as I found out, it's easy to find the door handle in the dark, and easy to open it whenever you need to. So after realizing it wasn't a big deal, and that I could open the door anytime, I closed the door, and floated away 2 hours without realizing it.

When your time is up, there is music that comes on, and gets progressively louder to gently wake you or get you out of your relaxed state.

There is no right way to do it, but I had a great time just floating around with my eyes open, enjoying the feeling of gravity mostly disappear, and also got some really good stretching in as well. Just be careful with the salt water, as you might expect, if you get it in your eyes - it stings! (but there is a towel with a water bottle near the tank door if you need to rinse)

There was only a brief moment in the beginning of my float when I heard a siren from the street, otherwise, I didn't notice any street noise at all, and considering what I saw when I left Float last night, that's really impressive (lots of police activity, another ambulance that I hadn't heard). I'm usually pretty sensitive to sound, so mostly for me it was nice to have some near-total quiet and no vibrations other than the sound of my heartbeat for a couple of hours.

I think they've got a great set up, and I didn't find their prices high (especially when compared with some other float places I've seen in the past) and they've got a variety of options to choose from on their website. 

The one thing that is worth mentioning, is that after floating and being relaxed and blissed out, walking out onto Queen Street at 1 am on a Friday night can be kind of shocking (not like this is a surprise of course, it's loud, and busy). I know I'd like to try and do a late night 2 hour float during the week next time. Otherwise, I had a really great time.</text></sentence><sentence id="341"><text>Another one of those lovely places that I'd probably have missed if it were 
not for the Indie Coffee Passport.

First thing Saturday morning, I went over there to meet up with Nicole H. for a minicoffee crawl.

I got there way too early, but the moment I walked in, I instantly felt comfortable and welcome. It's the kind of place I could see myself visiting everyday for a coffee. Very friendly atmosphere, the lighting was great, and there was ample seating (but of course,  it was 10am on a Saturday morning). It was obvious this was a local spot, people coming in and out, chatting with Bob (the owner) like he was an old friend. 

I ordered my usual large soy latte. It was so good. Thick, with a cute three dimensional heart made of crema. And I just loved the cup. I commented on it in my head and then again to Nicole H when she got there. It was the perfect size and shape to hold with both of my hands. Also, I was very happy to see they don't charge extra for soy milk!

Other things that are great: 
- They have free wifi (when I went in, the password was on the chalkboard at the front)  
- There is definitely an outlet at the back corner. I didn't look anywhere else, but there is at least one!
- There are vegan snacks, soups, sandwiches in addition to several nonvegan options.

Complaints: 
- None really. It's a bit out of the way for me, but I would go back anyway.</text></sentence><sentence id="342"><text>We went and saw a movie here on Telus Tuesday, where we got a discounted movie ticket, and a free popcorn and a drink. The combo ticket was cheaper than buying a regular ticket. Can't go wrong with that. Avoiding the massive price of snacks is always nice.

It's close to the Osgoode Subway station, I loved the copious self-serve machines,  and the seats were comfy. 

What is with the bathrooms though? First of all, they were kind of hard to find, and secondly, for a big theater there aren't very many stalls. I'm glad I went on a Tuesday in the middle of a movie, because I can't imagine what that looks like on a Friday or Saturday.</text></sentence><sentence id="343"><text>Working in the Yorkville area, I've come here regularly for lunch. I love the location and the interior. It's a nice break from the everyday, and it's automatically relaxing. Calm, ignorable, music fills the restaurant, interspersed with the occasional loud whirring of a blender.

I like that there is always a bottle of water on the table, because I end up getting a couple litres of my H2O intake for the day while I'm there.

I've ordered a bunch of different things, but the Pad Thai was easily (and most expensively)  my favourite. Nice filling serving, with a fresh rich flavour.

The nacho plate is pretty delicious too, but as some other reviewers have mentioned, don't expect a giant nacho plate portion here. It's not huge, but paired with a meal it's a nice snack.

Smoothies are always thinner than I expect them to be (and after ordering it several times you'd think I'd be used to it by now, but I'm not) so that's something to be aware of and set less thick mouthfeel expectations. 

Overall I like it here. I do find it feels expensive, especially since there is no guarantee of organic ingredients, but service is always good and not intrusive.

p.s. Get a macaroon (or three) they're delicious.</text></sentence><sentence id="344"><text>I went to here the other day. It had a lot of places to sit (most of which were occupied), free wifi, but no power outlets that I could find.

The latte I had was beautiful, but not super exciting flavourwise. I've been spoiled entirely by the Sam James Espresso Bar. The one from here, was probably the second best one I've had in the city so far though.

It seems like the perfect place for both hanging out (there are cozy spaces behind the coffee bar) and group work (they have giant tables by the windows) and it's a great location (close to Kensiginton Market.) 

They do charge extra for soy milk, and it was the second most expensive latte I've had, but I loved the space and would definitely go there again. Of the food items they had available, I saw a couple vegan cookies from Sweets From the Earth which was nice.</text></sentence><sentence id="345"><text>Tonight after nearly everything in Kensington Market was closed we saw a glowing light out of this new Sadie's Juice Bar location. Yes, it's open and right next to Hot Beans.

We picked up two Tofutti ice cream cones (they had vanilla, vanilla almond bark, and chocolate) and they were of course delicious. Lots of other options available (like drinks, floats, sweets from the earth treats, and soy delicious bars), but I didn't  pay enough attention because I was too excited about stuffing my face full of my vanilla Tofutti cone. (&amp; the person there was kind enough to let us in after closing, and I didn't want to overstay my welcome)

I'm looking forward to visiting them again during the day!</text></sentence><sentence id="346"><text>I walk by this place on the regular, and through the power of the Indie Coffee Passport, I decided to actually go in and check it out. It was crowded and very white, modernish interior, with an absolutely beautiful espresso machine. Their chairs aren't comfy and the interior was brightly lit with natural light from all the windows, so it's definitely set up as more of a pick up and go place than a sit down for a while place.

They charge extra for soy milk, and did so when it pushed the price over the $4 dollar Indie Coffee Passport limit. The service was indifferent and the soy latte was okay, but wasn't spectacular. 

They don't have any vegan baked items, though I think they had something gluten free while we were there.  Since I have too many options for really fabulous vegan friendly indie coffee shops in the neighbourhood I probably wont return to Thor.</text></sentence><sentence id="347"><text>I'm really digging this tea shop. I'm not in the area as often as I'd like to be, but when I am, I usually stop in for a cup of tea. It's a tiny space, but houses a nice variety of in house made tea blends. I didn't think the selection was really that small, but I think it's a sign of quality. Kind of like a carefully selected wine list at a restaurant rather than I "here is every single wine we could buy ever" list.

Service has been lovely.  The owner is consistently a nice, helpful person, and answers questions about tea and recommends things as needed.

They've got a nice variety of in house made tea blends. But since I'm a creature of habit (at least with tea) I will probably just order an earl grey or a cacao tea probably forever. I like that the cacao is from Chocosol, and that the tea tastes like some kind of chocolate magic, while still being light.

I'm going to have to look into some of their tea mixology classes!</text></sentence><sentence id="348"><text>We ended up at Ravi's Soups on Queen Street a few days ago, after a failed attempt to check out E.L. Ruddy (they were closed).

Ravi's Soups had a big group of people waiting for wraps, so that was a nice sign. They had a veggie wrap on the menu, and a vegan soup option. That said, I wasn't excited about this place from the very beginning.  Service was weird and all over the place, there wasn't a line waiting by the time we were at the counter, but he was still frenetic and rushed, but the food didn't come to us for quite a long time, and as with most simple vegetable dishes, I feel like I could have probably just made the wrap at home.

The veggie wrap normally has brie in it, and jut as a heads up, one of the unlisted additions is mayo... so you know if you're vegan, ask for it without, or just skip it and just opt for soup. (or go somewhere else.) The wrap came with a tiny salad, that of course, had "just a little bit" of mayo on it, I guess "a little bit" of mayo is the same as "no mayo"? Not quite.

My friend had the wrap and the Porcini Mushroom Soup and loved it. It's based on an onion broth, and has mushrooms, barley, and truffle oil in it, so it's actually vegan. However, soups all come with a cheese biscuit.

This place, like most of Toronto's restaurants, is great for lacto-ovo-vegetarians, but going there made me wish I had gone somewhere else on Queen that was a bit more vegan friendly with more exciting options.</text></sentence><sentence id="349"><text>Before we decided to wander through the AGO yesterday morning, we stopped into Frank for brunch. The server was awkward, stiff and extremely formal (in a way that seemed unnatural), but overall very attentive and helpful, so I wont hold her attempts at trying too hard against her.

Frank has a vegan dish on their brunch menu, the roasted shiitake mushrooms with heirloom squash, which was nice to see. The server suggested a slightly more substantial dish the chef could make for us with braised lentils and eggplant (also with heirloom squash and tat soi salad). It was phenominal.

Beautiful presentation, and absolutely delicious.  But, with phenominal food, comes a phenominal price tag, so that part was an unpleasant surprise.</text></sentence><sentence id="350"><text>I'd suggest any of the adults here check out one of Legoland's Adult Nights (which happen on the last Wednesday of every month), where you can enjoy a kid free Legoland. I don't know what it looks like during the regular days, but considering there were kids that didn't want to leave the park today, there must be lots of them. Happy to skip that. 

We booked adult night tickets in advance online, so it was a bit cheaper than getting them at the door, and while it still felt a bit expensive, I did spend around 2 hours running around the park and having fun on rides (there are two of them), playing games, and building cars (and then racing them) with LEGO, and building minihouses with duplo, so overall I had a good time. I also liked the miniatures exhibit of Toronto's downtown and area.

All of the staff was all friendly as well.

The thing is - Legoland is small, and there isn't *that* much to do. We finished with everything quite quickly, and found ourselves wondering what else is there...

It's in Vaughn Mills (a mall), at entrance 4. 
Go on adult night.</text></sentence><sentence id="351"><text>I snuck in here when it started to rain and wandered around looking at more Barbapapa stuff than I'd seen even when I was a child, adorable little baby products, cookbooks aplenty and the most beautifully unnecessary (albeit potentially useful) kitchen accoutrements and accessories.

I loved this store. Couldn't help making a little list in my head of all the things I wanted.

One of the folks at the cash was pleasant and even held the door open for me when I was coming in; the other one was pretty much off in her own world. Though this was fine with me, since I just wanted to browse the store in peace, and they didn't seem to care that I had been in there for a considerable amount of time.</text></sentence><sentence id="352"><text>A friend and I some time to kill before seeing a movie at the Scotiabank Theater so we went to Sushi Time and grabbed a bite to eat.

We ordered edamame as an appetizer and a few orders of cucumber and avocado maki. Well, we got our maki first, and it was good. It was a bit on the big side and loosely wrapped, but on the bright side, the avocado and cucumber were fresh. The edamame appeared after we had finished about half of the maki.

The service was friendly and we got our order quickly, but at the end of the meal we waited about ten minutes for a bill. Every moment one of the staff would go by we'd try and wave at them, but they'd come rushing past us. 

Overall it was okay. It's a decent spot to go before a movie, but I probably wouldn't seek it out on at any other time.</text></sentence><sentence id="353"><text>This gym is great. I'm not sure what issues people have with it, but this was my first experience with GoodLife and overall it was extremely positive.

The staff are friendly and helpful, the trainers were friendly, there are loads of treadmills, elliptical machines, bikes and equipment. Some old, some new. The best part about it, is that it is nearly empty.

I think the biggest selling point for me is that it has great change room facilities and amenities. Unlike the Liberty Village location (that is now my regular location), there isn't a mass veto on scented products, and they have lotions, different shampoos, hair spray, gel, deodorant, etc. There is a hot tub, sauna and steam room, and more than enough showers.

I liked it, now it's just too far out of the way to visit.</text></sentence><sentence id="354"><text>I went back here this weekend and had a pretty great time. The staff are friendly, the cafe was busy but the line moved quickly, and our soy lattes were delicious.

I still love this place, and I still wish I was closer to them because I'd drink their coffee more often. Staff are so nice, and seem to like working there and with each other. That makes a huge difference to the whole coffee experience. 

There are no vegan baked goods, but it doesn't matter, because their coffee is good enough to stand alone. (though you know... I wouldn't be sad if there was a vegan cookie or two someday...)</text></sentence><sentence id="355"><text>Before I finally moved to Toronto I stayed at the Fairmont Royal York. 

The main lobby was of course beautiful as most Fairmont Hotels are, but the hotel room was tiny. But the bed was comfortable and the room was spotless, and really - I just wanted to have a good nights rest in somewhere a bit fancier than a typical hostel stay.

Things that are great:
- Location location location.
- Products in the bathroom.
- Service was friendly.</text></sentence><sentence id="356"><text>Good tacos here. Its in North phoenix if you live far it wort it going you won't regret it. I tried there tacos and they are bomb.

Eggs Benedict for me was fab and some other good options on the menu. 
I told them we were celebrating a birthday and got a chocolate cake with a candle brought out which I was pleased to find was not included on our bill at the end!</text></sentence><sentence id="364"><text>What a great find for a quick lunch. The place was packed on a Monday afternoon,  but barely any wait even though there was a line. The roti chicken was delicious, along with the crispy yucca fries and a side of sweet plantains.

I have a great place that I will recommend (read my review about Portrait Innovations), however, I've been here twice and it got worse every visit.  

The first visit was for my maternity photos because my friend recommended this place (her photos are great) however mine was not.  The service was so-so, the sales person was that wanted to sell but she did take more than 30 shots.  When I received my photos they were all dark and we blended in the background but the proofs were completely the opposite.  

Ok so I let it go trying to give them benefit of the doubt.  

Second time was more than a year later for my son's 1st birthday photos.  This was really bad ~ the sales person is different from the last time and she was rudest person.  She rushed the pictorial and wouldn't allow a family shot because "per company policy" can only take 12-15 shots.  Bogus!!

If you want anything done you better show up right when they open. Even if you just want a shower for your pooch. For example I showed up yesterday 15 minutes before closing and receptionist said groomers all left for the day which makes sense. I went today one hour before they close and receptionist tells me all the groomers left. Wtf!!!!! Really! Man f*cl this place.</text></sentence><sentence id="432"><text>This Del Taco is just sad. We have been here twice using the drive thru and they have failed to give us hot sauce. Come on get your stuff together. I was gonna give you no stars.</text></sentence><sentence id="433"><text>I have been renting a property from Nicklin for about a year already and I have no complaints. When the water main broke all I had to do was call it in and the mainentance guys came and fixed it right away. Honestly I dont have any complaints i have been lucky not to have a major problems at my house. Keep up the good work guys</text></sentence><sentence id="434"><text>Great atmosphere and staff very friendly, hairdresser actually took time to get to know me asked question and gave great suggestions. My hair feels so light and heathy, will definitelygo back and make it my permanent salon. I will recommend to everyone I know.</text></sentence><sentence id="435"><text>There aren't many options when it comes to Persian brunch but this place offers one of the best breakfast/lunch dishes you can find anywhere in this city. 

Try Kalehpacheh if you feel adventurous. If you are Persian, you probably know what it is and you either love it or hate it. If it's the latter, then this is the place where you will fall in love with Kalehpacheh **100% GUARANTEED**</text></sentence><sentence id="436"><text>This place is really good. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable for the portion size. I eat here often and haven't had a bad experience yet.</text></sentence><sentence id="437"><text>Fun place to get a serious workout. There is really a great vibe here, the coaches motivate me and push me to my limits, in a positive manner. Both of the coaches I've worked with are professional fighters (UFC/Bellator) who emphasize technique and not just rep's. 

The other members are really friendly and welcoming. I felt right at home immediately.

If you're looking for friendly place to get in shape I recommend giving this place a try.</text></sentence><sentence id="438"><text>The average tasting sushi and friendly service was totally undone by the nearly hour long wait to get our food after ordering. The place isn't very big and was not busy when we place our order so the wait, in my opinion, was totally unjustified. 
Nice, clean and fairly priced...but way too slow.</text></sentence><sentence id="439"><text>Venue is fine: staff are business like but friendly enough, parking is handy, drinks aren't too pricey. The room is clean, good visibility with a slanted floor or upgrade seating on the balcony upstairs.

But...the sound mix is so bass heavy it buries the vocals and other instruments. we went to hear singer ZZ Ward, could barely hear her and none of the keys, guitar, etc. It was ALL bass guitar and kick drum.

Maybe for a DJ that is a great mix but a singers voice should be featured not unintelligible.

It was so bad we left early. wasted $, wasted evening.

Sheesh.</text></sentence><sentence id="440"><text>Bad sound mix/excessive volume ruined two visits.

Great looking new venue with fabulous possibilities. 

Reminiscent of the iconic Fillmore in SF.

Two shows later, the muddy sound mix with excessive volume drowning out vocals left a lot of room for improvement.

Seems a Live Nation venue would do better....maybe they need to hire someone to run the sound board who hasn't lost their hearing.</text></sentence><sentence id="441"><text>Terrible customer Service/Service refund refusal:

Three trips to the store and two home visits by service staff it was determined the internet extender network could not perform as advertised.

While, Frys was willing to refund the purchase price of the materials, the service manager refused to refund the $100 service/installation charge...even though their staff could not successfully install the equipment....concluding there was a design flaw preventing successful installation.

Even after a store visit, the manager continued to refuse to refund the service charge for their unsuccessful work.

Is it any wonder this chain is experiencing difficulties? This customer is not returning.</text></sentence><sentence id="442"><text>Cedars Cafe is fantastic!

I've been here a few times for lunch, and the service is great, and the food delicious. The falafel sandwich is perhaps my favorite! It's unfortunate that they charge for extra sauce (hot sauce especially). Otherwise a no-frills place to enjoy my lunch break away from the office.</text></sentence><sentence id="443"><text>Mike showed up on time.  He gave me a price over the phone,  but said we could negotiate up or down depending on what I had.  I should have rented a truck from Home Depot since it was only a pickup load size and weight. The cost would have been less than 1/2 the $200 he charged me.  I tried negotiating with him but no luck,  so I gave up. Wouldn't use again. Ron</text></sentence><sentence id="444"><text>The games are cool. But if you want customer service this is NOT the place.. They really need to understand of they continue "I could careless attitude" there going to lose there loyal customers..</text></sentence><sentence id="445"><text>The More of Total Wine &amp; More is why we went in.  While traveling we are always looking for unique and hard to find bourbons.  Ken was very knowledgable about their products and bourbon in general.  We really appreciated all the time he took with us to find just the right gift to bring back home.</text></sentence><sentence id="446"><text>I am not sure about others. This is my experience. On a saturday morning on MAy 21st there were two ladies as a customer service rep. The rudest I ever met. Gosh I wonder what they think about themself, its too hard for them to answer a question and ask you back rude questions.
Customer service at the poorest.
I hope somebody tell them, they really suck in their job. I wonder what make them so upset early in the morning. People shouldn't do their job, If they don't like it. Please leave the customers alone.</text></sentence><sentence id="447"><text>Reminded me of an overpriced cheap frozen pizza.  I will try a different place on my next trip to Toronto.</text></sentence><sentence id="448"><text>great experience from beginning to the end. Our driver Thomas was the best and made my family feel awesome. Thank you Thomas!</text></sentence><sentence id="449"><text>Moon Valley nursery has a great selection of trees, and Mark was very knowledgeable about varieties that were well-suited for my location. We chose the perfect tree for our yard, and the tree planting crew was fast and efficient. The tree looks great!  I highly recommend Mark and Moon Valley for all of your planting needs.</text></sentence><sentence id="450"><text>This is absolutely the best garage door company in the west valley. They are on-time for their appointments, and a pleasure to work with. The thing that I really appreciate, is their honesty. They won't try to sell additional products or services that you don't need. I highly recommend this family owned business.</text></sentence><sentence id="451"><text>After reading a description of this restaurant in the newspaper, I was very excited to take my mother, daughters, and sister for brunch. We were all very disappointed in both the food and the service. It took an hour to get our food.  My sister and I both ordered a medium rare cheeseburger that came out well done and dry. The burgers had no sauce, and were mediocre. My mother ordered pancakes, and they were rather dense and tasteless.  We agreed that none of us will be returning to this restaurant.</text></sentence><sentence id="452"><text>Great little brew house in Boulder NV. Great food. Interesting combos for burgers and salads. Micro beer sampler was great. Six moderate sized samples of diverse beers. Definitely a fun place to visit before or after visiting Hoover dam.</text></sentence><sentence id="453"><text>Quaint Mediterranean venu not too far from the strip. Large menu. Food was very good. A little spicy. Had several choices from moraccan to greek to italian. Service was friendly and quick.</text></sentence><sentence id="454"><text>This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I come here because the food is homemade, the flavors are amazing, and they take pride in sourcing and preparing a menu that incorporates quality ingredients. This diner is miles above any other diner I've been to, especially in North Carolina. Haven't had anything on the menu that I wouldn't order again!</text></sentence><sentence id="455"><text>Willow did an amazing job on my hair!!! I highly recommend her! I am sending my my mom to her asap!  I got color/cut/style and it is exactly what I wanted! I'm very happy with my hair! Already got several compliments!</text></sentence><sentence id="456"><text>Overall: Unless I was in the area, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. 

Service: Our food took a while to arrive but they all came around the same time. 

Food: I liked the dosa and curries. My mango lassi was room temperature.</text></sentence><sentence id="457"><text>I tried the beef brisket, pulled pork and butter chicken pies. My favourite was the pulled pork but they were all good. Each pie is hearty and the pastry was flakey. There was plenty of filling so one pie would be more than enough for me. 

The place is on a side road, tucked in the lower level. There are 2-3 stool seats inside but a couple larger tables outside. 

Frozen pies can also be bought and reheated later. The to-go box includes instructions on how to reheat the pies.</text></sentence><sentence id="458"><text>Got the lap cheung (Chinese sausage) and seaweed egg waffle and matcha ice cream. The soft serve ice cream was very creamy and while it was good, I didn't think it needed to be incorporated with the waffle.

The lap cheung waffle was an interesting mix of sweet and savoury. There was no line up when we went at night and the waffle was made well. Not underdone or overdone.

Wasn't going to come because of all the hype and most likely won't be back unless I happen to be in the area.</text></sentence><sentence id="459"><text>I liked my thin noodles and beef short ribs. The broth wasn't oily which was good. The tofu snack was ok, but not a must-get. 

I thought the shaved noodle was slightly too al dente for me but overall it was fine.

There's a Presotea inside but I didn't get anything this time.

Ordering from and iPad was easy and convenient for those who don't speak Mandarin. The menu is available in English and Chinese.</text></sentence><sentence id="460"><text>1) Margherita pizza ($10)
Nice thin crust with a good amount of cheese. Made in a stone oven. 

2) Broccolini and sausage pasta ($13)
Linguini was al dente, generous amount of sausage and broccolini. Good portion. 

The restaurant is a nice space. The decor was well done. The prices are a bit high for lunch but for dinner, this would be a good option.</text></sentence><sentence id="461"><text>1. Grabong ($10): Deep fried battered squash fritters with a garlic tamarind dip
- I really like this as an appetizer. The tangy dip complements the sweet squash well.

2. Gaeng Kiaw Wan in a coconut ($15): Green curry with bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, basil leaves, green peppers and coconut milk. Served in a coconut with rice. Choice of: chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, fish, tofu or veggies.
- Lots of meat in the curry. Good for sharing.

3. Khao Pla Tawt ($14): Crispy basa fillet with oyster sauce, crispy shallots served with 2 sauces: fresh chilli sauce and tangy tamarind sauce
- I loved this because the fish was crispy the entire time and it wasn't greasy.

4. Khao Soi with beef ($14): Fresh egg noodles in a golden curry topped with crispy noodles, coriander and green onions. Choice of braised beef, chicken breast or chicken drumsticks
- Consistently good dish from Chef Nuit. The golden curry is flavourful and rich but not heavy. Braised beef was tender. 

5. Papaya salad - salted crab ($10): Shredded green papaya, tomato, long green beans, garlic, red chilli, tamarind juice, fish sauce, coconut sugar and freshly squeezed lime
- The salted crab tasted like sashimi and though the claws were small, they were very salted which balanced out the rest of the salad. 

6. I Moo Ping ($10): Northern Thai Street Grilled Pork on a skewer
- 3 skewers</text></sentence><sentence id="462"><text>The squared pies and the box it comes in makes it easy to eat on the go. 

I tried the jalape&#241;o chicken and chicken pot pies in the big size. They were filling but the small ones would've been a great snack. 

There are about 15-20 seats inside and the decor is math (pi) and science themed. Each table also had a photo of famous mathematicians.</text></sentence><sentence id="463"><text>We went on a Sunday around 1pm and had to wait for about 10min for a table of 2. 

We ordered the eggs Benny on a donut and the stuffed french toast. I loved the ricotta stuffed French toast because the ricotta made it lighter than cream cheese. 

The donut in the eggs Benny was a nice change to the usual English muffin. The sweetness of the donut balanced the peameal. 

I would definitely go back for brunch and get some donuts to go.</text></sentence><sentence id="464"><text>Toronto roll
- Looks like a mess but loaded. 
- Top layer: cucumber, avocado 
- Middle layer: assorted pieces of sashimi 
- Bottom layer: tempura roll 

Overall:
Good sushi, big portions, price is decent for the quality and quantity</text></sentence><sentence id="465"><text>We were hungry and didn't want to wait for a table at Sushi House a few doors down. 

Grilled duck breast ($8 for 5 thin slices): It was overdone so it was dry and a bit tough. 

Katsu don ($10): The rice was too burnt on arrival and it tasted a bit too salty. There was a lot of rice and not a lot of chicken. 

Raku roll ($13): Their signature roll was small. Inside was white fish, crab meat and cucumber. The spicy sauce was good. We could taste the torched flavour (aburi).</text></sentence><sentence id="466"><text>The prices are good, the food is authentic and the portions are big.

The laksa is flavourful and quite spicy (even when we ordered as mild as possible). 

I liked the durian shake because I could taste the durian. This is definitely not for everyone.

Only a few seats available so it's best to get it to go. 

Call and order ahead because there is usually a wait, especially around lunch time.</text></sentence><sentence id="467"><text>Went on a weeknight and didn't have to wait for 2 seats. 

Squid ink/portobello 
Interesting flavours and filling despite the size if the dish. 

Offal sausage
Tastes similar to Chinese sausage. This almost seemed like a breakfast dish because it had an egg on top. 

Cannoli and waffle 
So good. The citrus flavour of the cannoli was light and refreshing. The waffle wasn't too sweet so I definitely could've had more than 1.</text></sentence><sentence id="468"><text>1. Big eye tuna sliders ($10.96): Ahi bigeye tuna, wasabi napa slaw, sweet soy, pickled ginger
- I ordered this appetizer for lunch and it was enough for me. Good balance of slaw and fish. The buns were soft and toasted.</text></sentence><sentence id="469"><text>I've only been when it was about to close but the pancake still tastes good. 

1. Brown sugar/peanut pancake
- Great warm snack any time of the day. Not too sweet and would go nicely with tea or coffee.</text></sentence><sentence id="470"><text>The venue looks nice. The food was decent for a wedding of over 250 people. The lounge area was very cold even when the room was full. 

The staff was ok. Not too attentive but given the size of the wedding, it's understandable that they are constantly occupied. They took away our champagne glasses after one toast so we didn't have them to toast for the rest of the night. Not a huge deal but wasn't sure why they did that.</text></sentence><sentence id="471"><text>I ordered a vermicelli bowl with 2 toppings (fried meat ball and spring roll) for $6.99. The spring roll was pretty small and it was mostly taro in it. There weren't a lot of noodles so the portions were on the smaller side. 

The tom yum noodle soup was spicy but the portion was ok. 

We wanted to order a sago dessert and were told that the kitchen was too busy to make it. The restaurant was less than half full and it was 8:30pm so we didn't think our request was too much. We understood that there was only 1 server but we would have been ok with waiting a bit for dessert instead of being denied completely. 

We will not be back.</text></sentence><sentence id="472"><text>I liked their version of a charcuterie board because it had katsu (fried pork cutlet) and shrimp tempura. 

I tried the soju flight and it was interesting. The flavours were strawberry, cucumbers and ginseng. 

The sweet potato fries and chicken wings were one of my favourites.</text></sentence><sentence id="473"><text>1. Pad thai
- Not ketchup-based or too sweet. Mine was salty but it would've been good if it was less salty. Not spicy. Comes with shrimp and chicken. 

2. Vermicelli with spring roll, shrimp on sugar cane
- Spring rolls were small and over-fried. Shrimp on sugar cane was bigger than other places.</text></sentence><sentence id="474"><text>The food was similar to a homecooked version I've had so I liked it. 

The restaurant's decor is modern and definitely stands out from the rest of the ones in the plaza. 

To order, you pay at the counter and find a table until your food is ready. There's a bit of confusion when the bell is rung because no one knows whose meal it is until you go up to check.

Overall, not a bad lunch spot but probably won't be on our regular rotation.</text></sentence><sentence id="475"><text>1. Burger - $3.05
Big burger bun, patty is pre-made from a manufacturer. Condiments and toppings are basic: saut&#233;ed/raw onions, mustard, relish, cheese (extra)  

Overall:
For a late night burger, it does the trick. 
No tables, just a counter and a bench. Many people eat in the parking lot or their car.</text></sentence><sentence id="476"><text>Usually go for the half price wings deal but that is no longer offered. Ordered the rib/wing platter to split between 2 people. 

1. Wing/rib platter 
- Big wings with good amount of meat. Ribs were tender and not dry. Fries, a lot. Also comes with vegetables. Good deal for $17 to share.</text></sentence><sentence id="477"><text>1) B&#250;n
I've been looking for a pho place that serves b&#250;n with this exact combination: spring roll, grille meat ball and shrimp on sugar cane. Finally found it here. 

2) Pho 
Broth was clear and light but still flavourful. Good amount of meat. 

3) Jackfruit milkshake 
Contains real jackfruit, not too blended so you could still feel the fruit. 

Restaurant was still 3/4 full on a Sunday night with a thunderstorm on the way. 
Service was fine, milkshake came at the me of our meal but maybe they were too busy or forgot. 

Would return here.</text></sentence><sentence id="478"><text>Opening Special: $7.99 (reg. 9.99) for many rolls. Ordered the Lady in Red and Sunrise rolls. The ingredients inside these 2 rolls were the same but we preferred the crab on the Lady in Red. 

Our server was friendly and attentive. 

The store is very small with only 2 tables of 4 seats. 

Free delivery available over $20 and within the delivery area. 

The 7.99 deal is great and hopefully they can keep it.</text></sentence><sentence id="479"><text>Bangcakes - $12 (Only at the Liberty Village location) 
Fluffy pancakes + caramelized banana + coconut + peanut brittle + pineapple
I don't love pancakes but I enjoyed these. The caramel sauce was a bit heavy by the end but we did dip into it generously

Corned beef + sweet potato hash + poached eggs + hollandaise - $15
I'm glad we shared this one. It was pretty good but it would've been too rich and heavy for me to consume by myself

Service 
Our server was good. She came by at the right times, not too often but not rarely seen either.

Reservations
I made a reservation through OpenTable but it didn't count towards any points. Too bad because it was the only reason I used OpenTable.

Menu/prices
The price was about expected for the Liberty Village area. If I go back for brunch, I'd want to try the French toast (duck confit) or the pork belly fried rice.</text></sentence><sentence id="480"><text>The nacho chips, guacamole and cheese dip were our favourite. 

Pulled pork, fish and bulgogi tacos were all just ok. 

The space is nice and fits with the King West atmosphere. Seating is "community" style (shared tables). You place your order and grab a seat when it becomes available.</text></sentence><sentence id="481"><text>1. Ice cream sandwich - half portion: Gingerr cookie (with chunks of candied ginger) + cinnamon toast ice cream
- I really like the homemade ice cream. It was creamy and flavourful. Cinnamon was not overpowering and did taste like Cinnamon Toast Crunch 
- Cookie wasn't too sweet or ginger-y

Overall:
I would go back. There was a lineup after dinner on a weeknight but worth the wait.</text></sentence><sentence id="482"><text>Good venue for an outdoor wedding ceremony and tented reception. Lots of nice spots for photos. 

Outside catering is allowed. 

The staff was good to us, the guests.</text></sentence><sentence id="483"><text>The McLean House was beautiful with many spots for wedding photos. The outdoor ceremony location was shaded by the trees so it's perfect for a late afternoon ceremony. There are many nice rooms for photos inside the house. 

The reception room was small so it's great for an intimate wedding. The lighting is mixed due to big windows on one end of the room. 

The staff was accommodating and took care of us (wedding photographers). The food was made well. Chicken was not dry and vegetables were fresh.</text></sentence><sentence id="484"><text>The space is very small but it's nice for groups of 2-4 (we had 3 in our group). The team is friendly and helpful when answering questions about the menu. I don't have a favourite dish but I liked parts of the ones we ordered. 

1) BBQ shrimp nachos: guacamole, tamatillo, chilli jazz

- The nachos were really crispy and overall I liked this as an appetizer.

2) Patty melt burger: grilled cheese, fried onions + French fries, chili mayo

- I love thin/shoestring fries because it reminds me of McDonald's fries :) The patty was juicy and thick. 
- I liked the grilled cheese, especially the bread. The chilli mayo had a hint of pear which was pretty interesting.

3) Fried chicken: sour pickle brine, warm mushrooms and potato salad, soft egg

- The fried chicken skin was similar to Kentucky Fried Chicken and the meat was very tender and juicy.

- The vegetables were ok...I'm just glad there were some greens. If you don't like mustard, you may want to avoid the veggies (notice all the mustard seeds)</text></sentence><sentence id="485"><text>Ordered the spicy sausage pizza. The sausage wasn't spicy at all and it was quite salty. The dough was good though. 

Also ordered the lemon sparkling drink which was refreshing.

Service was good. Friendly and attentive staff.</text></sentence><sentence id="486"><text>I like the appetizer rolls with lettuce and pork. It's definitely meant for sharing as the 2 rolls are cut into 8 pieces but can also be eaten as a meal. I also like to order the bun  (vermicelli) with spring rolls and Vietnamese sausage. For the quality and the price, I think it's good value.</text></sentence><sentence id="487"><text>Soft chorizo taco: The chorizo didn't taste like chorizo to me but the taco was good. 

Soft fish taco: I liked this one better than the chorizo even though I chose the chorizo. 

Overall, I liked the soft taco shell because it didn't taste as store bought as many taco places. There aren't many seats (6-7 picnic tables) but worth a try anyway. Tacos were $3.30 so it made for a good snack for us.</text></sentence><sentence id="488"><text>The French toast was thick (only finished 1 of he 2 slices) and the maple syrup has citrus flavours in it which may not be everyone's cup of tea but I liked it because it cut the sweetness. 

The eggs Benedict were good but the roasted potatoes stood out to me more than the eggs Benny.  

We got there at around 10 and had to wait about 5-10 minutes. Shortly after that, the line grew and it got very busy before brunch time.</text></sentence><sentence id="489"><text>I tried the Berliner donut which is a sugar donut with a vanilla bean custard inside. It was very good and not too sweet despite the sugar coating on the outside. The custard was rich and there were visible vanilla bean seeds so the flavour was good.</text></sentence><sentence id="490"><text>Sunday lunch: &#224; la carte lunch special ($12) or AYCE ($20)

1. Chirashi + miso soup + seaweed salad + 4 pieces of sushi 
- For $12 and 3 appetizer/sides, I thought the meal was good. The chirashi had a variety of items. I wish there was more salmon but can't complain for a lunch special. 

Overall:
- I enjoyed my meal. I've been to the Mississauga location and really enjoyed the pad thai there. I would come back to this location to try the pad thai. 
- 15% gratuity automatically added for large groups (we had 10 people) 
- Service was good. They let us split the bill and pay individually.</text></sentence><sentence id="491"><text>I called to make an appointment at the Yonge location but it was full so I was referred to the Eglinton location.

I called the day of my appointment to notify them that we would be late for our 1pm  massage and they said it was fine, as long as we got there by 1:30. When I arrived (before 1:30), the girl said they aren't able to do our treatment but to come back at 3, which we couldn't. We told them we called and they said it was fine if we were half an hour late. 

She showed us their handwritten agenda of the day, it turns out we were not even booked and there was another appointment booked at the same time. The girl at the Eglinton location said that the Yonge location takes their calls and makes the appointments. I called the manager and told her what had happened and she tried to convince us to go to the Yonge location to be treated right away. We were on a tight schedule so we couldn't but after this experience, we will not be trying to go back again.</text></sentence><sentence id="492"><text>We ordered 3 chicken shawarmas, a beef shawarma and a beef samosa. The beef samosa was very big and packed with meat. It was a bit spicy but not so strong that it would burn your mouth.

The shawarma wasn't that big compared to other places but I liked that it was warmed on a panini press first. They were 2 for $8.50 so for the price, it was good.</text></sentence><sentence id="493"><text>The Asian fusion aspect of the menu was not great.

1. Crab/avocado salad:
- Not bad but nothing special. Expensive for half an avocado and crab.

2. Lamb/duck prosciutto dumplings 
- Loaded with meat, crispy skin. I liked this one.

3. Taro fries
- The crispy ones were good but the thicker fries were chewy.

4. Ribs
- Expensive for 2 pieces of ribs. Very saucy and tender but wouldn't recommend this.

5. Steamed black cod
- Fish came in 2 pieces of aluminum foil. The small piece of fish was sitting in a pool of soup. The truffle oil was unnecessary and overpowering. Wouldn't recommend this. 

Overall:
We won't be returning due to the mediocre food and service.</text></sentence><sentence id="494"><text>1) Pad Thai (vegetable + tofu) - $8.95
Noodles had good texture (not mushy). A lot of vegetables and a variety. The base was not spicy nor ketchupy. They put a lot of peanuts on top which I like. 

2) Thai iced tea - $3 
Cheaper than most places but it is smaller. Either the tea was brewed stronger or there was less evaporated milk because the tea was darker than usual and not as sweet. It was different than other places but still good though. 

Small restaurant, 20 or so seats. It was mostly empty on a Sunday night so we didn't have to wait and the service was good.</text></sentence><sentence id="495"><text>Didn't know they had a brunch menu and happened to go at brunch time.

1. French toast
The french toast was filling and rich. The sourdough was good and not soggy. 

2. Wings
Small wings so they gave about 15 wings. Not bad but wish they were bigger.</text></sentence><sentence id="496"><text>Burger week

1. Blazing Pineapple Burger ($5)
- Decent burger. Good size patty and bun. Only special addition was a grilled slice of pineapple which did add a nice touch to it. The sauce was spicy and can definitely feel the kick after every bite. 

Overall:
Not bad for a quick bite but wouldn't go out of the way to get it.</text></sentence><sentence id="497"><text>All You Can Eat and Lunch Special menus available. Prices on the website are for the Steeles location. The Don Mills location seemed a dollar or 2 more. 

Chicken Teriyaki Don (not Bentoh) comes with miso soup and salad. Bentoh comes with gyoza too. 
- Chicken was a bit burnt and dry
- There was enough teriyaki sauce to cover the chicken and rice 

Service was good. Very friendly staff that spoke English well. Decor is much more modern than the restaurant that was there before, Tako Sushi. 

May return for AYCE menu.</text></sentence><sentence id="498"><text>Kaki Furai (Deep fried oysters) - $8
I don't love oysters but I actually liked this. The batter was crispy and thin and the oysters weren't dried out.

6-pack - $12
The outside of the nori was encrusted with...I want to say it was panko. It didn't look like deep fried sushi rice on the outside to me.

Spicy tuna 2 styles - $6
The pieces on the far left/right were spicy and the inside pieces were plain. Reminded me of bruschetta. But better.

Wild Jumbo Shrimp Tempura - $8
I don't mind wasabi but I wish it was on the side. Otherwise, I liked the big shrimp and the batter.

Mini Okonomiyaki - $6
Nothing spectacular, but a bit too much bonito flakes

Yaki Scallop - $12
These scallops were too dry for my liking.

Salmon on rice in soup - ?
That's literally what it was to me. The broth was interesting. At the end of each bite, there was a floral scent. It was like flower-scented soup. Not bad, but just unexpected.

Service
The staff was friendly and attentive throughout the meal. It would've been nice if they had told us which dish was which without being asked.

Reservations
We had to call a few times before getting through to book a reservation. The deal said that reservations had to be made 24 hours in advance but we called in the afternoon and got a seat for 7pm. The place was pretty empty when we got there but was almost full by the time we left around 9. We assumed it would be busier later on as it was more of a late night eats place (5pm-2am).

Menu/prices
I probably wouldn't go back if I didn't have a group deal like the one we had. We ordered 8 dishes and a beer. The total was just shy of $70 so we each ended up paying around $20 (for the coupon itself and tax+tip).</text></sentence><sentence id="499"><text>Spider roll - $11.99
This roll was bigger than expected and I was definitely full from it. I was impressed with the crispiness of the batter around the softshell crab.

Service
The service was good. We were given a complimentary pan fried salmon head which was unexpected and a nice touch.</text></sentence><sentence id="500"><text>When I was looking for the menu online, most of the information out there was out of date. The prices have gone up $2-3.

Spicy pork neck tacos ($10 for 2 tacos)
I liked the amount of meat and cabbage in the tacos.

Spicy pork buns ($9) - 1 burger cut into quarters
I liked that the buns were soft. We tasted the same spicy sauce in the tacos as the tacos. It was good but didn't jump out at me.

Soo yook - 48-hour braised beef ($12)
I'd skip this one

"Galbi ss&#228;m" set - short rib ($20)
I liked the galbi. Flavourful and not too much fat (I usually leave the fat behind).

Service
Our server could've been more friendly/pleasant. She wasn't rude but didn't appear very welcoming either. Maybe that's the casual vibe they're going for?

Reservations
They do take reservations, but when we arrived it didn't seem like we needed one on a Tuesday night around 7:45pm. I used OpenTable anyway to get points.</text></sentence><sentence id="501"><text>The food is not great but the price is ok. We don't come for the service but we don't have to wait for a seat during the Sunday lunch hour so it's bearable. If we have a group larger than 8, we get the party special. Otherwise the other lunch specials are reasonably priced (about $8-10).</text></sentence><sentence id="502"><text>On a Wednesday night, the restaurant was about half full so no wait needed for a table. The staff was great. 

Got a free delicious garlic bread with a Yelp check in. 

The small personal pizza is about 9-10 inches. 

Really like the simple minimalist decor.</text></sentence><sentence id="503"><text>I usually order the combo special of the day ($5.99-7.99). The meal is big enough for me to split into 2. It also comes with a small side of kimchi which you take yourself from the fridge. Combos come with miso soup, salad and jap chae (glass noodles). The fish/pork cutlets are huge and a lot of rice accompanies it. 

This is one of my go-to spots for lunch in St. Clair Centre. It's located in the food court, lower level. Tucked away behind a Chinese fast food place.</text></sentence><sentence id="504"><text>Food: 
Lunch specials ranged from $7-9
Thai iced tea was $3.50 but we found it a bit watered down (not as much condensed milk or tea flavour as we would've liked)
Pad Thai: sweet and sauce and not ketchup based
Khao Soi: the noodles didn't seem like egg noodles but the overall flavour was good. There was some spice to it which we liked. The beef was ok, not too dry like most places. 

Service: 
We experienced good service and had no complaints. Our server patiently explained the items we weren't familiar with. 

Parking:
We went on a Sunday for lunch and there was ample parking in the small plaza's lot. 

Overall: we would go back to try some other dishes.</text></sentence><sentence id="505"><text>I thought the the name of the place was clever. The words "noodle" and "face" sound the same in Cantonese. And repeating a noun in Cantonese is somhow parents would talk to their children. 

1. Jiajiang mien
- Not a lot of jiajiang sauce

2. Spicy noodles
- Noticeable amount of heat. Definitely big enough to share between 2 people with an average appetite. 

Overall:
Would rather head to Chinatown for noodles. Not a lot of seats, looked like under 50.</text></sentence><sentence id="506"><text>Pad thai (beef)
- The beef used was tough and chewy. The pad thai was too saucy. Lunch special for pad thai is 6.59.</text></sentence><sentence id="507"><text>I come here regularly and usually order the Pad Thai or Bun (vermicelli) with shrimp on sugar cane, grilled pork and Vietnamese sausage. 

The Pad Thai is large enough for me to split into 2 meals (but if you're a big eater, you could finish it in one sitting). It's on the sweeter side and not the dry kind. There is a generous portion of meat.

The Bun with shrimp on sugar cane, grilled pork and sausage is good. A good variety and filling. 

The pho is good. Not too salty and the broth is clear, not muddy. 

The owners are friendly and accommodating as we usually come with a large group.</text></sentence><sentence id="508"><text>I was going to try out this place after looking at Yelp and then was recommended by a friend. Asuke was my stylist and was great at recommending a hairstyle that suit me. 

I told him I was donating my hair and he was very careful in measuring the length. My wash was relaxing and not rushed. Asuke was detailed and spent a good amount of time on my hair. I was happy with the cut and the advice Asuke gave me on styling and taking care of my ends. 

I have never paid $50 for a haircut plus $12 wash before but since I hadn't cut my hair in 1-2 years, it was worth getting a quality cut.</text></sentence><sentence id="509"><text>I like aburi (torched) style sushi so I was excited for Miku. 

Came here at lunch on a weekday during the holidays and it wasn't very busy. We didn't make a reservation so we were seated near the chefs which is also away from the windows facing Queens Quay (could also be because we weren't dressed in suits?). 

The aburi was well done, not too torched. The seafood platter was good for sharing between 2-3 people. 

The staff was great but our food came out slowly.</text></sentence><sentence id="510"><text>There are some good deals from time to time. Good selection in a small space. Always clearance bins outside. 

Some brands sold include: Tretorn, Hunters, Frye, Birkenstock, Converse, Toms, Uggs, etc</text></sentence><sentence id="511"><text>Ordered from the Summerlicious menu. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the $35 price. 

There was nothing wrong with the food but the flavours didn't complement each other and the dishes weren't very special. We left disappointed. 

Service was fine and the staff was quick to clear our plates and utensils and replace them with a new set. 

Most likely won't return.</text></sentence><sentence id="512"><text>Nice decor but would rather pay less for the same dish at another location.

1. Vermicelli with spring roll and grilled pork 
- Crispy spring roll, pork was not dry. Noodles were not clumpy. 

Overall:
As nice as the decor is, the prices were higher than other similar pho restaurants and the menu was smaller. Service was good.</text></sentence><sentence id="513"><text>I like the patio on a nice day. There can be quite the wait. 

I usually order the fish tacos or the seared tuna salad. The fish tacos are nicely battered and the dipping sauce provides a nice kick. 

The salad is filling for me and it's light and refreshing for the summer.</text></sentence><sentence id="514"><text>Oysters were fine. The hot sauces that went with them weren't very hot at all except for the hottest one. 

My smoked salmon didn't taste different than store bought ones. My homemade ice tea was unique. Not too sweet and wasn't l overpowered by lemon either. 

Our server was very nice and accommodating. She made some good suggestions to us. 

I'm not sure I would return. I may go back to Diana's Seafood instead.</text></sentence><sentence id="515"><text>Expensive Mexican food. Ingredients and technique were good but execution could be improved. 

Ceviche verde
Nice big chunks of fish

Pollo en Pippian Rojo
The chicken was bland and the red sesame sauce/ancho chile didn't add much flavour, just spice. Could've used more salt (I usually don't need to add more salt to anything)</text></sentence><sentence id="516"><text>I only come here because it is cheap and there isn't usually a wait or a very short wait. There is a tea surcharge but still ends up being cheaper for the same amount of food as other places. 

The quality is fine..especially for the price. 

There are about 3 large tables for groups of 8 or more. Mostly tables for 4-6. Some tables of 2 along the wall. 

Lots of parking (the plaza is mostly empty).</text></sentence><sentence id="517"><text>1. Loukoumades (Fried dough balls with honey): fully soaked in the honey syrup and sprinkled with cinnamon. Good, but probably even better when warm. 

2. Galaktoboureko (Greek custard pie): Loaded with custard. The custard was not too sweet and wasn't like a smooth pudding consistency; it was thicker and not runny.</text></sentence><sentence id="518"><text>We had a reservation on a Friday night at 6:30 and the place was practically empty. We asked for a room which had space for our legs below. Service was fine. 

The food was fine. Nothing above and beyond what you would expect. The sashimi pieces were a good size. The sushi rolls didn't have too much rice. My tuna/avocado tartare appetizer was bland so it tasted like a tuna roll without the rice. 

I probably wouldn't come back.</text></sentence><sentence id="519"><text>Duck salad - $15
My favourite dish out of the 6 we ordered. The portion was bigger than I expected. A good mix of textures and flavours. Warning: peanuts.

Rare beef - $16
There were 4 slices of soft rare beef. I thought it was ok..probably wouldn't order it again.

Tartare 2 ways - $10
1) Spicy tuna with avocado on a crispy rice cake
2) Salmon with shallots on a crispy rice cake
I enjoyed the tartare and the deep fried rice added a nice crunch

Braised spiced short ribs - $22
This was my least favourite dish but it was probably because I was expecting thinly sliced short ribs (like galbi short ribs). 

Shanghainese steamed pork belly with sauteed brandy apples - $19
The pork belly was ok.  I don't like cooked apples so that didn't appeal to me. 

Our meal came with complimentary dessert (I believe every diner gets it) which was a nice surprise. 

Service
We went shortly after it opened so we weren't surprised when there were a few dishes that were delivered to us by mistake, but the staff was very friendly. Kai came out to chat with us and apologized that we couldn't take a photo with Susur because it was during the dinner rush. 

Menu/prices
Overall, I liked our meal. It's out of my price range so I probably wouldn't go back unless it was a special occasion.</text></sentence><sentence id="520"><text>1) Crepe 
- Nothing special about the crepe. The basic topping was jam. Costs ectra for toppings like fruit, nutella, etc.

2) Macarons
- Flavours sound unique but some were strange. Lavender was my favourite. 

3) Creme brule 
- The custard was ok. The brule could've been done better. It didn't taste like it was made to order.</text></sentence><sentence id="521"><text>A small brunch spot.

Ordered the Smoked Trout Plate and Eggs Federal. The trout plate had a lot of trout and overall the meal was filling. 

The poached eggs in the Eggs Federal were overdone but the rest of the dish was good. 

Also got a house made root beer which was similar to a typical/common root beer but tastes more earthy.

We came at around 10am on a Tuesday (during the holidays) and we didn't have to wait for a table.</text></sentence><sentence id="522"><text>If I go back to Lee, I would only order the slaw again. The decor and ambiance in the main dining area are  Asian-inspired, as expected but also appears somewhat dated. 

1) Singaporean-style slaw

We ordered Chef Susur's famous signature dish, the Singaporean-style slaw ($20) and added tuna sashimi ($10). This slaw was very good. There are so many ingredients but they work well together and it was refreshing and light. 

The tuna sashimi was smoked on the outside and it didn't really add any flavour so I would probably skip that. The tuna does add a contrasting texture to the crunchy slaw. I arrived hungry and felt full after eating half of this dish.

Note: there are peanuts. 

2) Peking &amp; Char Sui Duck ($29): Beijing duck garnish, steamed pancake, foie gras p&#226;t&#233;

This is not the same as what you would expect from a traditional Chinese restaurant style Peking duck. I didn't enjoy this very much. 

3) Warm Molten Chocolate Cake ($12): caramelized jackfruit &amp; banana, vanilla bean ice cream

Nothing unique about this dessert but it was delicious anyway.</text></sentence><sentence id="523"><text>For the price, the lunch specials are well worth it. Lunch specials are on until 3pm. 

We ordered some specials like ma-po tofu, General Tsao chicken and corn/fish on rice. All were priced between $5-6. 

The portions were good. My ma-po tofu was big enough to split into 2 meals. The staff was friendly but did get one of our orders wrong. To be fair we did have a group of 12. 

The restaurant is small but has 2 large round tables and a few smaller tables. The plaza doesn't have too much parking but the plaza isn't usually packed so we didn't have troubles finding a spot (but we did go on a Sunday). 

We'll come back because of the price and location.</text></sentence><sentence id="524"><text>The nduja sausage pizza was very good. The thin crust was not too crispy and not too soft. 

Another favourite was the anchovie pizza but I wish there were more anchovies. 

The calamari appetizer was great for sharing for 2-3 people.</text></sentence><sentence id="525"><text>Customizable level of spiciness and niceness. Even a mild level of spice may be too much for someone who can't take much heat.
Ask for additional noodles at no charge. 
Can only pay by debit with minimum $20 purchase. 
The lamb noodle bowl was ok. The lamb smell wasn't that strong.</text></sentence><sentence id="526"><text>A new grab 'n go sushi shop. Regular price: $3.99 for small boxes, 5.99 for large. Grand opening special, 40% off. Just opened this week so not too much variety yet but regular prices are better than other sushi joints. Quality is good so far from what I can tell. The ratio of rice to fish is fair. It's too early to make any concluding thoughts but will be back to get a quick bite.</text></sentence><sentence id="527"><text>I thought the pho here was ok. I came on a recommendation but didn't find the broth a standout. I did notice that it was empty at dinner time on a weeknight but filled up when we finished around 9pm.</text></sentence><sentence id="528"><text>Pricing seems standard for Chinatown:

Monday - Friday* 9pm - 4pm (*Except holidays)
Dim Sum Special $2.00/dish

Monday - Friday: 4pm - close
Saturday - Sunday &amp; Holiday
(S) $2.38 (M) $3.28 (L) $3.68

Overall:
The dishes were all as expected. Nothing too greasy or too dry. Went on a weeknight and it was mostly empty. They charge for tea but it's fine given the price of the dishes.</text></sentence><sentence id="529"><text>I've been twice and was glad that the food was good both times. The prices are decent for the entertainment district and the quality of the food. 

The zucchini fritti was good but a bit too oily. 

Arancini came in 3s and it was nice for sharing. Not a must try though.

The prosciutto pizza was good. The crust was very thin so if you like thin crust, you may enjoy this.

Overall, pleasantly surprised and would prefer to come here over some of the other "nice" restaurants in the area.</text></sentence><sentence id="530"><text>1. Maki set
The maki sets contain large rolls but the rolls are similar so it almost feels like you ordered one type of roll. 

2. Sashimi boat
- Each piece was thick and evenly sliced 

Service
Great staff 

Decor
There are individual rooms with curtains or tables in the main dining area. 

They take reservations but we've never had to wait. The location is not the best but there is lots of parking.</text></sentence><sentence id="531"><text>Service was rushed and the staff didn't clear the plates often so the table was full of piles of plates. This was towards the end of the night with an hour left of service. 

Last call was at 10 and the staff was turning down the restaurant even though closing is at 11. 

The food was ok. Some special rolls were interesting but the menu was about the same in quality and selection as other AYCE places. 

Overall, not a great experience and would not return.</text></sentence><sentence id="532"><text>Went on a Tuesday night at around 7:30pm. It was pretty full. Only a couple tables available (one was for a large group, one 2-person table). There are a few counter seats for single diners. 

1. Ma Po Tofu - $6.95
Very spicy. No ground beef like most places. Lots of chilli oil. Good but wish it had meat in it. 

2. Pork intestine, hand pulled noodle 
A small bowl had quite a lot of noodles. Not mushy noodles, firm texture. Pork intestine was a nice balance. Broth was flavorful but not too salty.</text></sentence><sentence id="533"><text>1. Coconut chicken soup ($9.95): coconut milk, lemongrass, ginger, chicken, mushroom
- Strong lemongrass flavour, very thin and watery consistency

2. Pad Thai ($10.45)
- Saucy and sweet</text></sentence><sentence id="534"><text>Decent Indian food. Not incredible, but not bad, either.

I usually go for the lunch buffet ($8.95/person) since shelling out $50+ for a decent dinner for two doesn't give me the food for value I can get elsewhere in town.  As someone else mentioned, they have a late-night 1/2 off deal, but unless you want to eat dinner around midnight, it doesn't make too much sense.

Nothing stands out in my mind as a "must have" or "to die for".... But, on the flip side, nothing is a "must miss", either.</text></sentence><sentence id="535"><text>This place has been around for decades. And Coraopolis is full of Italians from the homeland. However, I don't know any of them that eat here regularly.

After the place was featured in Diners, Dives &amp; Drive Ins, I figured what the heck, I'll give it a try. I won't make that same mistake again. The sauce was oily (as was shown in the episode) and bland and noodles were tasteless. Home made? Maybe. But not the way I do it. It wasn't the worst Italian I've ever had, buy definitely not up to Pittsburgh Italian standards.

How anyone could rate this 4 or 5 stars is beyond me.</text></sentence><sentence id="536"><text>Love this place. Best new bar/restaurant in the area. Limited, but excellent, on tap beer list. Food is solid. Good vibe. If you haven't been, definitely give it a try. Similar to Good Fellas on Mt. Nebo Rd. acros the river.</text></sentence><sentence id="537"><text>Another one of my favorites in the Burgh. Kaya has been around for quite a while and it used to be a refueling stop for me on Christmas Eve before diving in with the shopping masses on Penn Avenue.

Their specialty, tropas, tropical tapas, were here way before Ibiza and all of the other tapas bars in town caught on with the idea of serving little dishes. Although, the tropas menu has been substantially reduced from Kaya's glory days, there are still some tasty treats on the menu. 

The tuna tataki (or whatever it's called) - sashimi tuna, seaweed, sesame seed, all chopped up and marinated in a soy-based sauce, served cold and with some crackers is great. I also like the conch fritters; and the tofu cracklins - deep fried tofu served with a sweet, chipotle sauce (a little too sweet and not spicy enough for me - nowhere near the heat of mapo doufu - but it is good nevertheless).

I have never tried any of their main dishes...so I can't comment on them. It's usually 3-4 tropas between me and the mrs.</text></sentence><sentence id="538"><text>I rarely give out 5 stars. It has to be incredible food and drinks or something so new and delicious that nothing else compares. With that being said, the Naked Grape was very good time, the place is intimate (maybe 10 tables total?), and also has a decent wine list for the Burgh.

The food was fresh and good, although portions were a tad on the small side, so we ended up sharing plates like a tapas bar and kept ordering until we were full. I would definitely go back for more. 

As others have mentioned, you can sit and eat at the bar, which is not a typical bar used to serve customers drinks before they are seated - it is definitely meant for dining and you can even reserve seats at the bar.

The owners, who were inspired to open the place after a few trips to Italy, were working that night and service was pleasant and attentive. It is a hidden gem and not your typical restaurant in the Burgh.</text></sentence><sentence id="539"><text>Best burger in the O.P. hands down! Fire alarm burger mmmm.....it's in the old Wayne's Lounge / Mutzig's building for yinz old timers.  Hand made chips, fries, and burgers - always fresh never frozen.</text></sentence><sentence id="540"><text>Excellent dry-aged beef. You won' find a better one in town. And you will pay dearly for it.

Similar in atmosphere and menu to Morton's, the Capital Grille is located on the ground floor of the former Lazarus building at the corner of Wood &amp; Fifth.

Expect dark paneled wood, a massively overpriced (300% and up) wine list, and oil paintings of Pittsburgh's forefathers (including Mr. Rogers).  The little things, like impeccable service by the bartenders, and umbrellas to your car on rainy nights by the valet staff, are refereshing. 

Regarding the food - appetizers were just ok. I'd give a big thumbs up to the any of the dry aged steaks (simple and delicious and the house speciality) and a thumbs down to the Filet Oscar (Filet Mignon topped with lump crabmeat and a bearnaise sauce).  Also, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries (if you like truffles) - these are to die for. Desserts are nothing special - I'd give a pass on the key lime pie. 

When I go back, it's straight to the dry aged steak and truffle fries for me.</text></sentence><sentence id="541"><text>One of my favorite places for breakfast in the area.  No frills, Mancini toast, reasonable prices (like $4 to $7 per person)

If you are really hungry, try the 3-egg scramble (3 scrambled eggs mixed with grilled onions, peppers, sliced italian sausage, and melted cheddar cheese) - with Mancini toast (and butter). If you finish all of it, you probably won't need to eat again until dinner.

The 2 &amp; 3 egg combos are also good. Sandwiches for lunch are not bad, but breakfast is definitely a better call.</text></sentence><sentence id="542"><text>Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the "unspoken house rules": 

1. Order first (do not try and sit down).
2. Wait for your food while standing.
3. Find a seat (if one is available).

Under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.

My wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.

Little did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: "you can either sit there or there", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the "unwritten rules" to us.  An "excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down" would have sufficed.

So, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money.</text></sentence><sentence id="543"><text>If you love well done burgers, then this is the place for you. Also, if you love homemade potato chips instead of fries.... Me not so much.

Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad. The five alarm burger is nicely spiced. But forgot asking for med rare or medium burgers. You're getting well done like it or not.</text></sentence><sentence id="544"><text>Let me preface this by saying I love sushi. Nobu Matsuhisa and Kazunori Nozawa are two guys I used to visit frequently in LA for the good stuff.  I mean the really really good stuff. Andy's Sushi Bar ain't in the same galaxy.

However, I must say, Andy is the man. How can you go wrong with a take-out only sushi restaurant inside the largest fresh fish market in town (Wholey's)? Especially in a town like Pittsburgh which doesn't come to mind when you think fresh sushi.

I've had my fair share of nasty fish around town. Even in some nice places that looked like the fish should have tasted better (and fresher) than it was. Then I found Andy. No frills, no bar, but hey, the fish is as fresh as you're gonna get in these parts of the USA.

People seem to line-up for his endless list of rolls - and there are plenty. I never got why someone would order a Fried Chicken Roll. Personally, I prefer the lunch special which includes 8 pieces of nigiri sushi (whatever is fresh that day....usually yellowtail, tuna, salmon and eel), as well as eight pieces of some roll Andy throws together in front of you - like a spicy California Roll or Salmon and Cucumber Roll. You get what he thinks is the freshest catch of the day. Total is around $14.00 for this particular order.

And one other word of caution, especially around holidays and on Fridays, Wholey's can be jammed with people - I mean packed - so if you don't like crowds, or if you don't like standing in line to order your food and watch Andy make it fresh - then CALL AHEAD and place your order for pick-up. 

There is also a decent sized dining room upstairs (paper covered tables) that you can eat in if you don't want to take the food to go.</text></sentence><sentence id="545"><text>Great place in da Burgh! Took the whole family. Sushi, yellowtail collar, salmon udon, mmmmmmm. Stay away from the wings..... but a great place on a warm summer night. Love it!</text></sentence><sentence id="546"><text>The best coffeehouse in the Burgh, hands down.

If you love Starbucks, stay away. The is not your run of the mill same old, same old coffee chain ala Starbucks, Caribou, Crazy Mocha, etc. etc. tt is the one and only and it shows.

It took more than a year to renovate this South Side loft into a very comfortable and neighborhood feeling coffeehouse and you can tell down to the minute details. From the real fireplace (I am sitting next to as I type) to the handmade coffee bar when you first walk in, Big Dog is something better experienced than described.

Everything is made fresh on premises, including the pastries and soups. If you are in the area and looking for a really good cup of coffee or my personal favorite - Mocha Bianca - stop in. You won't be disappointed.</text></sentence><sentence id="547"><text>This place has been sold once sold twice sold sold sold. And the food has going more downhill than Kyle Rasmussen at Incline Village circa 1982..... give it a pass.</text></sentence><sentence id="548"><text>Without question, the best, and most authentic, Mexican restaurant in town. We're not talking Mexico City Mexican, we're talking Baja California Mexican.

The menu is quite simple and the food is awesome. The margaritas are small, potent, and pricey - but worth it.

My favorite dishes include: the shrimp cocktail appetizer with chips (good for sharing), and the mahi-mahi fish tacos. The burritos are huge and also recommended - try the surf n turf, wet (red sauce). It is enough for 2 to share (especially if you have starters).

No reservations are accepted, so if you go on a Fri or Sat night, be prepared to have a few cocktails at the bar.

Also, if you are a fan of chains like Mad Mex or Don Pablos, I wouldn't recommend trying Azul. You will come out of this place saying the prices are too high and the portions are too small. 

If you prefer quality over quantity, Azul cannot be beat (unless you fly to LA or head south of the border).</text></sentence><sentence id="549"><text>Never...Never....Never consider this dealership sales department.  They should be working at a used car lot in the boondocks.  Run for the hills!  I honestly believe we were racially profiled and gender profiled.  They don't respect customers who just want the "bottom line".  They want to play patty cake and pretend it is negotiations.  It is plastered all over their wall, (literally) painted that they respect their customers.  I guess if you see and read something everyday you actually believe you are demonstrating those values.  SOOO NOT TRUE!  Find another dealership where they respect the intelligence of women and others.

Oh yeah,  they tried to keep us at the dealership, by pretending that we had taken the keys to the test drive vehicle.............HILARIOUS!  

Only thing I can say is that Ruben in service is very committed to customer service.  He has gone above and beyond to help my daughter.  Maybe he can teach the guys in the front about ethics.</text></sentence><sentence id="550"><text>Typically I purchase my gear at Nordstrom. While in Vegas for a business meeting I needed a pair of jeans. It was nice to see an AG stand alone store. Staff was extremely helpful and efficient. Go see Aubree, she was a huge help!!</text></sentence><sentence id="551"><text>One of the most wonderful hidden gems in all of Europe.  You'd almost miss it (we stumbled upon it accidentally.)  The owner is extremely welcoming and friendly, and will discuss wines and offer tastings.  The small bites and apps are amazing.  They'll also ship wine internationally, in case you fall in love with their own label from their winery nearby.</text></sentence><sentence id="552"><text>I have shopped here since 1998 when I got back into keeping tropical fish in a live plant environment. after a few year's off.

I like that incoming livestock are kept in quarantine after arriving, that I can ask to be told when a particular species becomes available, that the staff are so knowledgeable and enjoy discussing the hobby, even though I notice some impatient shoppers just wanting to grab and go. 

Reminds me of the now closed Pirrhana on Avenue Road that was run by a hobbyist, or Fintastic in the east end run by Mike.

Harold the head guy has saved a couple ailing fish with clear advice.

Just in case this seems too high a rating, keep in mind that I have seen a lot of fish shops since I began the hobby sixty years ago.

And plant and fish prices seem as fair as elsewhere.</text></sentence><sentence id="553"><text>Here sushi equates to much ice-cold rice with very skimpy bits of fish on top. Had to ask waitress for wasabi and ginger and given inadequate amount.
Salad floating in dressing, bland miso soup.

Slow service.

A year or two ago one could get a decent lunch here.</text></sentence><sentence id="554"><text>Creative cooking. Modern cool joint with pleasant staff. 

Loved the soft small gnocchi with 'nduja- though I found only a tiny morsel of this delicacy in the savoury sauce- and my friend enjoyed the Ontario perch which is difficult to cook well. Asparagus side imaginatively broiled and seasoned, al dente very yummy.

Overall very good food and a fresh approach though 25% overpriced on many items , the perpetual problem of focusing on decor that costs $$$ to build in.

Give it a try, I will return despite the cost issue.</text></sentence><sentence id="555"><text>I am very pleased to have found this restaurant which is several cuts above other pho joints I have eaten in in the past thirty years. 

It starts with brilliant pho broth: here is a very complex , low salt highly complex broth . It reminds me of the broth used by the sadly gone White Lotus on Lansdowne that was my flagship spot  for excellence until it closed about three years ago.
Anyway hooray for excellent golden turtle broth. I had the soup last time which brought me back today.

I tend to evaluate using two or three standard dishes and today it was vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and spring rolls. Verdict: massive shrimp lightly grilled, lots of tender pork and as in earlier visits very plump non- greasy spring rolls which I dipped in Hoisen sauce as an experiment.

My bowl of Bun had lots of mint and bean sprouts, and the accompanying sauce was not too vinegary all well balanced.

Overall extremely satisfying and served up with flair and professional skill in a very busy lunch hour. 

So I will go again though it puzzles me to see some negative reviewers dissing this place for another pho joint nearby. Guys, stay out of the commercial rivalry and avoid negativity! Life's too short.</text></sentence><sentence id="556"><text>What makes a really goog neighborhood joint? For me it's not just quality cooking and decent prices- it's the sense of being welcomed and appreciated.

I have been dropping by for lunch three or four days a month often with a friend since the current owners remodeled the former Tokyo Sushi opposite  St, Paul's Chuch (where Tafelmusik plays).

The food decor and atmosphere have stepped up greatly. I have tried many items but my fave is the Chef Combi with salmon teriyaki and sushi. it includes generous sashimi as well. Many veggie items too.

Only a light dinner needed after such a feast.

No friend has ever disliked Maido and my friends are 
Mostly picky foodies. 

Anyway, it's my kind of low-key friendly place, give it a try.</text></sentence><sentence id="557"><text>Having read raves I decided to eat at Sea Witch on a quiet Lunch hour. 
There was  only  one other diner and about five staff.

No big deal being served , right?

Not that there was much effort to break off conversation and speak to me as I waited for a welcome. Finally ordered and having confirmed with the pleasant cashier that yes I would like tartar sauce, I was then asked by two different servers if I happened to want tartar sauce. 

It seems that the staff don't pay much attention.

 I told the last one that I had been asked twice already and received no reply, though in the end the sauce was supplied.

Pacific haddock was tasty but more batter than fish and the chips were lukewarm, far from piping hot as they need to be for taste and texture.

Slackness kills reputations, the decor and concept are good but the execution left much to be desired.</text></sentence><sentence id="558"><text>Pleasant staff, decent food and fair prices, yet what might have been a perfect brunch on a warm summer Sunday today  was considerably diminished by many wasps swarming the patio tables.

I was told the owners refuses to use wasp traps or even one of the effective fake wasp gadgets that keeps wasps away.
It's not even an expensive fix to protect diners so what's going on here?

It's a matter of time before someone gets stung and sues for damages.

Too bad, but shows a lack of care for customers!!

I down rated the place by two stars for that reason.</text></sentence><sentence id="559"><text>I don't understand why this restaurant has such bad reviews. I live next door so I pick up food fairly often. Everything I've tried has been really tasty. (General Tao, shrimp in lobster sauce, noodles, sushi...)</text></sentence><sentence id="560"><text>Great food at a great price! 
I had brunch there and got 2 eggs, plantains, beans, half an avocado, cheese, and a chicken tamale. I asked for scrambled eggs and to my surprise they added tomatoes and peppers. Everything tasted great! It's a good change from the regular brunch staples.</text></sentence><sentence id="561"><text>WAYYYYY too much hype about this place!! Seriously though... No seriously. 

Only good thing about this place is how they are good at making the portions look decent in the photos lol

Service: 
the waitress was no offense an airhead she was so distracted looking around at people seemed to have a bad case of ADHD

She knew nothing about her drinks list or about the food ... Was gone when we kept trying to order more food (we had to order with the bar back because she took so long to show up)



FOOD: 
Tater tots :  meh not worth it 
Cauliflower app: meh over cooked and nothing special 
Corn bread: alright but really not worth it .... Unless you are feeding tweety bird. 


Kentucky handshake sandwich: not worth the price (it's literally Kentucky fried chicken ... Like might as well go there and pay $6 instead of basically $15 to look at some arm ) lol 

Chicken and Waffles : portion is not worth it flavor was alright nothing mind blowing (go to the Kensington market one ... WAYYY better and much more for your money) 
 
Red Funnel cake : save your money .... Tiny over cooked and completely over drizzled with icing ... Yuck  worst thing I have ever had in the funnel cake department.


We ordered more food but honestly don't waste your time ... Just go somewhere else.... Not worth even going on about how bad it was.</text></sentence><sentence id="562"><text>Service was really great fast quick friendly but the food was a terrible..... 

Blanco roll was the worst..  it's like someone squished egg, tuna from a can and panko crumbs and made it a roll.... As if that's not bad enough they make it resemble some back ally hotdog by adding pickled jalape&#241;o to it.... Gross if you like fish cakes and hotdogs this roll is for you. If not I highly recommend staying away. 

If they made it simple with avocado raw fish and other non over powering tastes then sliced raw jalape&#241;o over it then torched the butter fish it would probably be the best sushi roll here. 

Volcano roll was okay but really over done with the sauce quantity which took away from enjoying fish ... Which is why I go out for sushi. 

The sashimi plater (30 pieces) was pretty bad aside from the octopus and 3 of the 9 cuts of salmon.... Everything else was off temperature. 

Complimentary salad was small cute and good. 

The miso soup was good. 

Tea was average. 

Ginger is really good here.

Wasabi is really weak here. 


I hope the chef seriously considers the suggestion I made about the less sauce and torched raw jalape&#241;o.... Ja Bistro has mastered it and it's incredible.... Maybe the chef should check it out and see what I mean. 

Would not recommend this place. Will not be coming back.</text></sentence><sentence id="563"><text>I was on the phone trying to order with Khao San Road for over 30 mins calling back over and over again. No one picked up. Called here they picked up on the third ring took my order and had it ready in 15mins with a smile on their faces. 

^ that is service worth  great job! 

Will defiantly be coming here more often.</text></sentence><sentence id="564"><text>Always great friendly service and fresh baked bread and desserts everyday. 

Highly recommend the custard cakes they are the closest thing I have ever tried to the original Past&#233;is de Bel&#233;m in Lisboa  

The rice flour cake is also really good and a good option for those whom do not like cake too sweet. 


The bean cakes are great here too!  orange, almond, and a few others I have tried are all good. 


Can't go wrong with Nova Era</text></sentence><sentence id="565"><text>-6 stars ...I have come here several times....


The staff is friendly. However, I feel they have not been properly trained in making the drinks they sell. 

The coffee beans are good quality however, sometimes the load is packed to tight and the espresso comes out with a burnt taste. Other times in a latte it is either too over heated or comes out like a cappuccino. 

In the simplest way put very inconsistent and not in anyway good. 


Some of the desserts are really over priced for the quality and quantity you are getting (i.e. Small Almond croissant $4.20) 


Today I ordered an Early Grey. The earl grey tea I had tasted moldy .... It also made me sick.... Which makes me question what type of hygiene they have there. 



Will not be going back to this place ever .... They are a disgrace to cafes. 


Tip* go to the Starbucks upstairs in the indigo or across the street... They are closer to what it should really taste like.... You will get the coffee, late, cappuccino or tea the way it should be done.</text></sentence><sentence id="566"><text>-5 stars literally saw the 'chef' lick her fingers over and over again while I waited for my orange juice. Then she started setting up people's dishes .... With her bare hands...Disgusting place... Extremely unsanitary!!!! After waiting 10mins to receive my orange juice while almost puking watching the levels of sanitation plummet more and more I was then presented with half a cup of juice. When I asked to upgrade to a full cup I was then told that's the only amount I can buy? Okay guess they don't want to make money. 

Tip- save yourself the nausea go somewhere  else</text></sentence><sentence id="567"><text>-5 stars!! Worst place ever. Don't bother going here you will definitely regret it. 

Save your money for a better serviced, hygienic, more organized and professional establishment. 


(You would think when a party of 40+ people are coming they would provide better service considering all the money you just brought into this dump for them) 


No one from that birthday will ever be wasting our time making that mistake again.</text></sentence><sentence id="568"><text>Really small place to grab ice cream which is fine considering we have more cold weather than summer. The ladies who were making the cones were very pleasant and had great vibes... The person who was at the cash the first time I went seemed a bit stuck up but then the second time the front cash/ barista was also very pleasant and seemed to have very good vibes.... Hopefully I see more of this side the following visits too. 


LOVE the cashew latte with the Brazilian blend  perfection ! 


Ice cream ($6 I would say they should be priced more at $4) was good quality for a soft serve.... It was defiantly not the same quality as McDonald's or an ice cream truck WAY better. The only similarity is that it melts quickly ... Like any other soft serve. The cones could be a little better quality because they do get pretty soggy at the end.  

Love the creativity they have with the cones! I hope they continue to come up with new ideas. 

Small suggestion on the cinnamon one... Maybe add some nuts ... The current topping just seems so plain jane compared to the other creative cones you have! 

Definitely going back to try more flavours!</text></sentence><sentence id="569"><text>All I have to say is .... if you're going to get a tattoo and want it done RIGHT and like no other place in toronto go see RAIDEL at adrenaline!!!! 

I originally had an amaZing tattoo artist in Kensington (Vince) who unfortunately moved back to Venice, Italy. Fate brought me to the hands of the very talented RAIDEL! 

His passion for creative designs and art is phenomenal! He has done quite a large AMAZING piece on me and most of it he just did FREEHAND  (That is talent!)  

The thing I LOVE the MOST about his many talents is the fact that he has something that I find is SO RARE in a tattoo artist... he can create that FLOW into making your tattoo not look like a stamp ... but a part of you... an art that can even take previous pieces and make them one! I have about 1 3rd or fourth of my body tattooed and this tattoo SAVIOUR turned my several prior tattoo pieces (ribs, shoulders upper back) and with his new addition turned my body into a canvas with one solid flowing united piece. Brilliant engineer in designing.     

Adrenaline is quite pricey ..but if you are getting it done with him IT'S WELL WORTH IT. If I wasn't so broke ass I would give him a HUGE TIP as appreciation for his VERY hard work and TALENT! I intend to repay him some day by surprise for the lack of the TIP he deserved that I didn't have at the time.


This HARD working FRIENDLY always smiling singing ARTIST will make you NEVER WANT to go anywhere else with all his talent and positive energy!</text></sentence><sentence id="570"><text>Quick very friendly service this evening! She was very welcoming and made some suggestions after knowing it was our first time. 

Butter Chix- Creamy subtle kick of butter chicken spice... Saucy very enjoyable!  

Mum's Chicken Pie - Classic  was not disappointed LOVE the touch of Chardonnay really gave it that extra little something 

Traditional Aussie - Saucey , meaty, has a little potato (not too much... Which I really appreciate because I didn't have an allergic reaction to it from that very reason ) 

Surprisingly even though these little guys are the size of your palm they are actually decently filling ! ... You might just need 2-4 to fill you up depending on how much you can handle. 

Price is okay ... About $7 each Palm sized pie. They have 4 pies for $24 to take home and cook located in the freezer ( I feel that is a better suited price for the cooked ones too)   

On the plus size the hand held sizes lets you try more flavours!! 

Would recommend people to check it out!</text></sentence><sentence id="571"><text>The only good thing at this place is the friendly staff... The food however is ...terrible. Save your money. I don't know how someone can over cook rice into a mash! The curry was literally just curry no veggies or anything... And I felt like I was drinking curry soup that was much too creamy and not enough spice. Also had the Tom Yum Shrimp soup... Very disappointing it was literally some powder tasting broth with 3 shrimp and a couple mushroom slices... Not a traditional Tom Yum at all. If they had a -1 star I would have put it.</text></sentence><sentence id="572"><text>Customer service from both staff today was really great. So I ordered the matcha latte .... Drank it and my stomach turned it is really sweet! I don't mind sweet treats but when it comes to beverages I am only a fan of bitter and sour things.... They happily (literally with a smile) offered me another beverage. I felt pretty bad because I hate wasting but I just can not do sweet drinks.


FYI their matcha powder has sugar mixed into the packaging they get (just like Starbucks).... Which would be great ... Unless you are not looking for a sweet drink... 


Great news! Their soy latte is amazing! Deep rich coffee bitter flavor (which I love). I was very pleased by how calm and positive they both were with me as I am sure that was probably annoying to have to waste the product  More coffee shops should have this type of professional positive smiling customer first type of employees 


Location also has a fireplace which o imagine will be nice in the cold winter months. Washrooms are clean (probably because now they aren't bombarded with all the school children arroyos the area coming in and disrespectfully destroying it and leaving it messy every 30mins.</text></sentence><sentence id="573"><text>Love love love Quantum Coffee  100% better then Starbucks (and done properly) Lattes, Cappuccinos and flats, Oh my!   


Also a few cents cheaper then Starbucks(but WAY better in quality)! 

Service is always great baked goods are always amazing and super fresh! (Also sent in from local bakeries ) 


Did I mention they now have a reward coffee card ? That's right Starbucks .... You have zippoooo on Quantum... Suck my kiss.</text></sentence><sentence id="574"><text>LOVE the food here! 

Always amazing friendly service. The atmosphere is good it's a very simple place inside out but the food is killer! I always come here when I need my Korean food fix! 

The pork bone soup is awesome the meat basically falls of the bone! (Perfection) 

The Bibimbap is always my go to dish! It tastes like the best mothers home cooked meal! 

I love how they are always attentive to make sure you get your pickles and such at the beginning and how friendly and welcoming they are. Great place to go with a family, group, as a couple or alone!</text></sentence><sentence id="575"><text>The fish taco is really good. 

Burrito boys makes the best burritos this place... WAY too much bread ratio not enough of anything else. 

The other meat tacos  not good meat tastes more like old leftovers from earlier that week. Lol gross. 

TIP: if your going only get fish tacos</text></sentence><sentence id="576"><text>Authentic home made curries ...

Great Tom Yum 

Pad Thai is good 


Vibes are relaxed 

Music not too loud 

Fills up quick because it is a small Resturant. 

Staff pleasant.</text></sentence><sentence id="577"><text>Several unfriendly / unhelpful staff. Unorganized. Will not be returning.


Went in to drop off a prescription staff was rude and when I insisted on leaving my account information she cut me off and told me she would get everything she needs when she contacts the other location to move my prescription over. 


I return 2 days later (no phone call left to let me know they were filled). I get there and had to wait 30mins for this also unfriendly staff that seems to apparently hate her job to give me my prescription. Apparently it's too challenging for the staff to process a simple refill pickup.</text></sentence><sentence id="578"><text>Late review .... Wayne was amazing! Best massage therapist I have ever had hands down unfortunately I found out he no longer works here  now I need to find him</text></sentence><sentence id="579"><text>Use to come here all the time and loved it! 

Service needs a little work but more importantly lets get to the food reviews 

Starting with my personal favorite...

Ravioli di Zio Paperone -Great 
homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig, roasted butternut squash, sauteed with oyster, button mushrooms and parmigiano

Tonnarelli alla Norcina - Good 
Italian black truffle shavings, homemade spicy sausage, pecorino 


Tagliatelle alla Bolognese- Great 
traditional bolognese rag&#249;, parmigiano 



Tonnarelli ai Funghi - Good 
oyster and honey mushrooms, porcini sauce 


Cavatelli al Ragu' D'Agnello -Great 
handmade cavatelli, lamb braised in tomato sauce, Pecorino 


Gnocchi alla Simi- Good 
tomato sauce, fresh ricotta, basil, parmigiano 


Rigatoni Arcobaleno - Good 
mozzarella di bufala, zucchini, light cherry tomato sauce, basil 


Agnolotti alla Lilli -Good 
stuffed with spinach, ricotta and pecorino, butter, sage and parmigiano

Spaghetti in Canna a Mare - Okay 
fresh clams and mussels, calamari, scallops and tiger shrimp, light tomato sauce 



Apristomaco - Appetizers 


Carpaccio di Manzo- Great 
hand cut, raw beef tenderloin, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, parmigiano reggiano shavings, arugola


Funghi Assoluti - Good 
basked oyster mushrooms, parmigian, bread crumbs, extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, arugola 

Frittura di Calamari - Okay
deep fried lightly floured calamari

Tagliere del Salumiere -Good 
selection of Italian and local cured meats 
Tagliere di Formaggi - Good 
selection of italian cheeses served with honey and homemade jam 

Insalate - Salad 

Only one I have tried is Caprese and it was Good. 


Pizze - Pizza 

They are well done thin crusts .... I personally like Napoli, Margherita, Bufalina, Quattro Stagioni, Santo Stefano, Da D&#243; a D&#225;, Smendozzata, Li Pecuri, and finally C't Mang. 


Dessert ... I always get a flourless chocolate cake heated .... It's a perfect finish for my dinner with a cappuccino or latte</text></sentence><sentence id="580"><text>Desserts and bread are always great at Nova Era. Customer service is terrible. 

Desserts always a great variety and always fresh. 

Couple recommendations; custard cakes, bean cakes are all amazing! 


Customer service.... After waiting in line for 15mins with only two people in front of me I was told to go to the other counter to order my sandwich.... After ignoring me for another 10mins the extremely rude woman making sandwiches doesn't even greet me and in a very unfriendly manner tells me to basically go sit down and now wait to be asked what I want.


20mins pass and I am still here sitting and waiting to have someone approach me to take an order. I will never be coming back here to eat and HIGHLY recommend only coming for the bakery stuff only here! 


Terrible fucking service.</text></sentence><sentence id="581"><text>Performances are great but the crowd and music needs a little work. Also they shouldn't space out all the wicked performances sooooo far apart.</text></sentence><sentence id="582"><text>"In cod we trust" great deep fried fish toco (but fish portion is small) 

"Beef Cheek" braised and good portion 

Tuna Chive in hard shell toco okay portion ( a little too drenched in sauce) 


We had some ribs "special of the day" portion not worth the price AT ALL ... Sauce is a type of honey garlic (drenched in mayo ) not worth the money. 

 I had high hopes for great food here after reading the reviews ...but was over all not really that impressed.</text></sentence><sentence id="583"><text>Chicken and waffles are awesome! 

And that's about it folks 

Don't bother with the pasta or hamburgers (was not impressed at all). 


Friendly staff who seemed to disappear after giving us our food .... For a long while.....</text></sentence><sentence id="584"><text>This place is a hit and miss some times the food is really great and flavourful and other times I have ordered food that was over salted or just bland. 

Service has been okay. Portions are a hit and miss for some things. I don't think I will be going back after my last visit though.</text></sentence><sentence id="585"><text>DO NOT GO HERE!!! If there was a minus 5 star I would have put that. Seriously they are gypsies here...you order sushi for take out.... They send you with some panko filled rice and drizzle oyster sauce to make it look like eel roll. Warning they use the WORST quality fish too!</text></sentence><sentence id="586"><text>Love this place .... Honestly best Burrito in Toronto  Halibut is tasty, simple, flaky .... Brilliant</text></sentence><sentence id="587"><text>Not authentic at all..... NOT AT ALL 

Khao Soi ..... Not sure who paid all these reviewers to call it "authentic" ... I am a HUGE fan of Thai food and have NEVER had coleslaw ... Yes that's right ... Literally COLESLAW in the Khao Soi. It is disgusting. Beef was not tenderized and undercooked.  

Tom Yum - the only average thing worth maybe trying if there is nothing else open and you need food. It is heavy on the lemon grass and is missing the fundamental herbs and spices.... For starters galangal .... Had no freshness to the soup .... Tasted like over cooked boiled veggies that had some paste added  choice of meat and severed.  


Curry is not authentic at all .... It is a pre-made paste added again to something cooked separate.... Then served. A paste at a Resturant considered to be authentic should be made in house and better quality.


Service was fast. 

Servers were fine. 

Music was fine. 



Overall poor quality food.... Will not be coming back and DO NOT recommend this place to anyone.</text></sentence><sentence id="588"><text>Awesome home cooked style food! What a little gem we found! The outside is a little off putting but once you go in its a completely different situation.

Service was great ! Friendly professional classy staff and great priced filling traditional food!  

Cabbage rolls - saucy simple and tasty 

Perigees- loved the potato ones!! 

Schnitzel- tender, not oily, tasty  

Very fresh ingredients ... Really satisfied our home cooked craving</text></sentence><sentence id="589"><text>Butter tarts really well done, they have a bourbon one that is also very good for the liquor lovers. 
Chocolate and butter croissants very well done and properly texturized. Almond croissant was a bit on the drier side 

Macaroons
Matcha &amp; white chocolate - had a strange fridge radiator after taste which I hated and the matcha was too mildly infused. Earl grey has a chocolate filling which is honestly, too overpowering for the bergamot notes. Red velvet also more chocolate in flavour not quite enough vanilla (maybe just the supplier). 

Over all there were a few I did really enjoy and would recommend, as I would select the following flavours again upon my next visit  100% Salted Carmel then, Hazelnut, Pistachio (could be a little stronger but still amazing) , Lavender, Boston cream is very true to flavour, Raspberry, and Chocolate. 

Honestly, the last time I came in but NOT the first three times ... but the last time .... all my macaroons had a really off putting stomach turning fridge taste. As it was the only time that happened I will he going back as I love the lavender and salted caramel macaroons ! 

Have yet to try the pies but they look fabulous along with the scones and meat pies.... can't try everything in one day ;)</text></sentence><sentence id="590"><text>Great friendly service was provided they had a sale on so I went a little over board with the shopping and the staff was there to help me find my perfect sizes for everything I needed.</text></sentence><sentence id="591"><text>Staff taking orders in such a rush they mess up my order... Which I only find out 10 mins after watching the barista mess up my drink twice ... Which she claims 'someone must have taken'  

Then to complete her customer service the barista then speaks to her coworker and makes me go BACK to the line to pay the extra $0.63 cents for the mistake they have made  

What a joke where do they find these people? Never thought I would find such horrible people working at a coffee place as all my past experiences at many other coffee houses have been great. 

Tip - save your money for a Timmy's or other coffee place in the hospital.</text></sentence><sentence id="592"><text>I have been here before but my last experience was not good at all. 


The bad - the younger lady who served us seemed like she does not like her job ... She made our visit unpleasant right from the entrance ... She seemed a little arrogant too.... And was not very familiar with the desserts. 
I am not a fan of lemon desserts but I do not mind something with a tiny note of it (as I know a lot of baked desserts often do have a little in them) ... When I specifically asked for her recommendation she gave me an extremely lemony dessert. I also requested a no foam latte and she seemed to also miss that one as she handed me something that closely resembled a cappuccino. 

I love the heart of this place ... It was actually a bit heart breaking with my last visit as I have come in several times throughout the past couple years and have not received this type of treatment. 

The good- Love the desserts here I usually always grab a mix box of the traditional southern Italian almond and pistachio biscuits and am always very pleased with the texture, the flavour and the combination of them! 
The bread here is amazing highly recommend you try anyone of them (I am sure you will love it! ) 

The coffee beans they use here are also very robust and strong which I love.


I try to ignore the treatment I got here last time .....because maybe she was just having a bad day and was taking it out on us .....but to be honest that's no excuse, ever ... And it will effect me to now go closer to Bathurst and collage to go get my almond pistachio fixes from more pleasant staff.</text></sentence><sentence id="593"><text>I really love the butternut squash soup here... It's one of the things that has always stayed consistent even after the change of hands after the owner passed away.  


Curry Lamb Wrap - Good 
Has a great spicy kick .... Perfect for winter and autumn days. 

Chicken Wrap- Good 
Chicken is tender and cooked simple but well. Can't go wrong with the chicken. 

Steak Wrap- Usually great but last time was way over cooked... They need the cook to keep a closer eye on the meat to make sure it's still pink on the inside of the beef.... 

The fact that it was over cooked made me think maybe they downgraded the meat quality ? Regardless now I will only be going there for soup!</text></sentence><sentence id="594"><text>Highly recommend this place if your looking for a dedicated, experienced, professional who really listens and goes above and beyond to get the job done! Everyone is extremely helpful positive and kind. 

 I started coming to Myodetox after my boyfriend always telling me about how his whole volleyball team loves Boris and his magical fixing hands. I was not disappointed! 

At first I was going to Boris to help with tightness in my hamstrings, hips and shoulders. Results were often immediate and helped me achieve better form and dig deeper in my workouts. 


After my car accident and suffering from some serious whiplash and  a terrible concussion Boris really dedicated his time to help me. 

He informed me on what to expect with concussions and whiplash and how to overcome my daily obstacles while being rehabilitated 

They do a lot of services here! It's like the one stop shop for anyone's needs! I have had Physio, massage, acupuncture, cupping, and even things on vestibular rehabilitation. The list really just keeps going. 

I still have a long way to go but I have made some incredible progress which I owe all to Myodetox! 

Through my experiences thus far I can honestly say Myodetox really will bring back the new you</text></sentence><sentence id="595"><text>Quick service ... Tasty flavourful food... the chicken kabob is great and tender, tandoori special gives you a nice mix and the beef kabob is also very flavourful and tasty. 

Salad could use a little extra something something but is fresh ingredients at least for now. 

Great place if you need a quick bite.</text></sentence><sentence id="596"><text>Suffocation best describes the services given at this location. The rep was sooooo annoying. She didn't even ask for what we were looking for and kept bringing us what she normally wears in sizes that aren't even our size it was like she was having a conversation with herself or something ..... Like every min she brought me something new to try on.... It made me feel frustrated annoyed nauseated and obviously did not want to buy anything ever from here again. 

I will be going to the other locations from now on to get proper service.</text></sentence><sentence id="597"><text>Food is good. Fresh house made broth great flavour and not salty like most soups I have at restaurants... Fair price for quantity and quality of food. Beef Flank soup is really good here. Service was fast!</text></sentence><sentence id="598"><text>Pricy but really good waffles  

Good chicken portion. Let's keep it like that don't turn into home of the brave portions!</text></sentence><sentence id="599"><text>Great selection .... When in stock. They need to get people who understand the products that they sell... Came in several times and it was hard to find anyone on the third floor who could help me with anything really. 


I'm pleased with Micheal's being in the area none the less. I just hope for future hires they consider always having at least one person who understands what they are selling. 

The first time I went in for gold leaf paint no one was even around to help.... Out of all the floors I finally managed to find a representative on the third floor. Once I asked her where I could find it she asked me to wait because apparently she was the only person working and had 3 other people in front of me?! How can such a large store be so understaffed on a weekend morning I don't know.... I was very happy to see on my second visit that this has changed.

They now have many more reps working the floor ...unfortunately when I went to ask about some stain glass products again, I was not able to get the help I needed from the first representative.... I was however referred to Amanda (on the ground floor) who was able to answer my questions.

Service is definitely getting progressively better.   


UPDATE***

Went back a couple more times since and they are definitely getting things more organized! 


I have to say I really love all the 50% off coupons from this place! I don't go to any other places for art supplies anymore because of the amazing prices and they stock is unreal!</text></sentence><sentence id="600"><text>Terrible service .... Terrible over cooked wings. 

Literally was like eating dried out oil jerky ... Not sure how they are still in business. 


Tip* save your time and money go somewhere else... Anywhere else will be better.</text></sentence><sentence id="601"><text>Love love love this place! 


Tacos tacos  

Firstly just need to say I put the habanero hot sauce on everything here to give it a little kick! ... If you love spice defiantly try it.  Also rule of thumb *squeeze* that lime on everything ! Tacos and in drinks .... Just go wild. 

Shrimp tacos were juicy and great 

Fish taco was great and flaky 

They had a Trout taco day feature which was great (with a little lime and hot sauce)

Chicken and beef tacos had a decent amount of meat in them and were nicely cooked and shredded. 

The Vegetarian option was surprisingly also very tasty and flavourful 


Ceviche love the jalape&#241;o touch inside but fish and tomatoes needs to be chopped up more for better chip grabbing fun. 


Margarita pitcher could use a little more lime less agave and more tequila.... Less sweetness and more pungent twist and kick in the mouth to go with those tasty tacos. (I just ordered extra tequila and added to my cup.... But I would say about 4 more shots in the pitcher would fix it)

Over all very great vibes...music is beautiful loud and upbeat. Friendly staff. Great place to go grab a bite laugh and enjoy a fun Latin vibes time</text></sentence><sentence id="602"><text>Great, friendly, quick service.... The Red , yellow and green curries are great  creamy and has a nice flavour 

Red - personal favorite we get this all the time. 

Green - little spicier so not recommended for those who do not like spice 

Yellow - good .. not spicy</text></sentence><sentence id="603"><text>Love love love ! Great food! Really hits the taste buds of sea food lovers ...the best way! 

have been here many a times .... Love how they change up a lot of the plates! Always a new adventure  

(Summer nights)Lobster Bisque - creamy buttery not over salty just perfect! 

(Summer nights)Scorpion Fish with Roasted Garlic Mash - Garlicy creamy perfect mash - Fish was flaky tender perfect ... Severed with a side of roasted crisp veggies. 

(AIl year)personally love the smaller oysters ... I usually eat 12  just for me! 

(Entering spring)Tuna Tartar -Fresh And Toasts were a perfect duo

(Autumn) Seared Tuna with a creamy broth was absolutely perfect and the long chip

Clam Chowder - Creamy perfection with a little potato</text></sentence><sentence id="604"><text>Was very displeased as a regular client of Khao San Road. 

I have come here for a couple years... always in person. 

The other day I tried to order take out I was trying to get through for over 30mins calling over and over and over again. I was EXTREMELY unhappy with the fact that I was pushing close to an HOUR with trying to order food. I called Northern Thai and they picked up the phone immediately.</text></sentence><sentence id="605"><text>REALLY dry ribs, pulled pork tasted like watered down sauce was added after cooking. 

Mac and cheese was creamy and good not over cooked 

Slaw was good- just normal slaw 

I honestly could not believe how dry my ribs were.... It was pretty heart breaking as I had been looking forward to going there just for that for sooooo long ! 

Brisket was cooked well ... For most of the pieces I got because again part of it was dry. 

Tip***The sauces are good but they need to leave the ribs in for a longer cooking time seriously tho .... Please do.... Ribs are suppose to fall of the bone not be like jerky .... If I wanted jerky I wouldn't order ribs. 

Customer service was great! Very friendly and helpful. 

This place has a LOT of potential to go so far ... The major loss of stars for me was because when you are a bbq house that advertises ribs like that I expect them to know it is suppose to fall off the bone.</text></sentence><sentence id="606"><text>Great Japanese Cheesecake!! I loved it!! 

The only thing they need to figure out is an effective way to get that line moving faster. It can be a very long wait ... Which makes the  whole experience negative for people.... Taking away from the enjoyment of the products.</text></sentence><sentence id="607"><text>My dog is really nervous(shaking, hiding, an occasional growl) at the vet.  Other places I have been the technicians make a comment about her being scared, ask questions, then leave. At countryside the technician went out of her way to try to calm my dog. My dog even gave her kisses, which she has NEVER done in the 10 years I have been taking her to the vet. I wish I could recall her name, because she was excellent. Dr. Hoppe was wonderful and knowledgeable and made our visit quick and easy without trying to add any tests or procedures that weren't needed. Because my dog is so nervous she is often overlooked as being a good girl, so I appreciate the nice words that Dr. Hoppe said about her! The free hugs and kisses on the bill is also a nice touch. Thanks for the good experience!</text></sentence><sentence id="608"><text>The veggie burrito here is a staple in my diet. Great place, simple good food and nice people. The student deal is awesome.</text></sentence><sentence id="609"><text>this is hands down one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to, not to mention vegetarian. food is great, people are great. I will be back.</text></sentence><sentence id="610"><text>I was unfortunately very dissatisfied with my visit. After having been recommended by more than one person for their Thai food, the Pad Thai and Massaman dishes were bland and lacked many key ingredients. The Pad Thai was particularly sparse lacking leeks, raddish, and especially the bean sprouts....and it isn't Pad Thai without bean sprouts.

In short, isn't worth the wait or the hype.</text></sentence><sentence id="611"><text>DO not use this company !   The "owner" is rude, obnoxious, self absorbed and if the lack of business is any reflection of the work they do (NO cars,  no repairs, not busy ever) - then that should tell you ** ALL ** you need to know.  Whenever you walk into a company and there is NOTHING going on - then you should be suspicious.  This guy needs a course in Customer Service - but it wont matter - doubt he will be open long enough.   DO NOT USE - don't subject yourself - PLENTY of other quality, caring, busy automotive repair places right nearby.   PASS THIS ONE OVER .....</text></sentence><sentence id="612"><text>Best fried chicken I have ever had. We went for brunch and started with the fried green tomato BLT. It was so delicious and unique. Next I had the chicken and waffles and my husband had the plain fried chicken. We both agreed it was the best fried chicken ever. The cocktails were delicious and so were the mimosas. I wish we had saved room for desert! Service was excellent and I loved the ambience.</text></sentence><sentence id="613"><text>Best cocktails in Vegas. You can add a shot or double shot to any juice. I got the spicy mango with tequila based on recommendation from the bartender. It was life changing. Also tried the kiwi blast and monkey. Very strong drinks at a great price and amazing fresh flavors.</text></sentence><sentence id="614"><text>We came here for brunch on a Monday.  Pretty tasty food!  Great selection of both brunch food, and regular dinner-type food.  The price was much better than I expected it to be for a Vegas buffet (around $24), and it included a free mimosa/bloody mary/champagne.  The decor is amazing, complete with great hanging glass installations in line with the rest of the Cosmopolitan hotel theme.  

Definitely try out the desserts (especially the great selection of gelato, and the chocolate covered strawberries!) as well as the macaroni &amp; cheese.</text></sentence><sentence id="615"><text>Came here for lunch after a long night of partying.  I'm a huge fan of French food, and had definitely been craving it ever since I arrived at PH and saw that the Paris was next door.  Mon Ami Gabi definitely satisfied my craving!  A friend and I split the steak classique (steak with butter), and the quiche Lorraine.  So good!!!  The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare, as requested.  The quiche Lorraine was delicious, but I was so full by the time I got around to eating it that I only had a few bites; what I did eat was perfectly balanced.  My friends seemed to enjoy their orders as well.  I only wish that the restaurant served steak tartare... I would've been on that like white on rice!

Side note, the bread is served warm and crusty, the way it should be.  I wanted to eat the whole baguette myself, not to lie... but highly disappointing was the cold butter! 

Definitely worth coming here for a meal that is nice, but not too nice (I'm looking at you, 16-course tasting menu at JG), when you're in Vegas.</text></sentence><sentence id="616"><text>I want to like this place SO MUCH.  The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  

To be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would "incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue "fighting".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. 

If this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. 

In short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.  I'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one I had in a large group.</text></sentence><sentence id="617"><text>So noisy we could not have a conversation.   Asked to be moved.   There was a table available but not for us.   No accommodation made.  We left.  Won't return.</text></sentence><sentence id="618"><text>Love their food..I went for their mac and bacon dish and it was yummy....the butter chicken that my husband had was so good too. Would be nice to have more chicken in it but other than that the food rocked. Waitress was great and she looked busy since it was packed house when we came in on Tuesday night since it was wing night.</text></sentence><sentence id="619"><text>I heard raves about onion rings being so good. I was a bit disappointed when I tried their onion rings. It tastes ok...not terrible but no seasoning to it. I like the A.&amp;W.'s onion rings the best. Crispy and firm at most A&amp;W's. Peter's were simple and bland. Maybe a bit like back in the 50's?  The burger was ok; it looked to be put together as an after thought and squished. The good thing is the variety milkshake flavours. That was what I was into; but for me; the milkshakes didn't have enough of that dairy/ice cream flavour for me. It was good but not giving me a wow factor. It didn't taste like real ice cream shake to me. I won't rave about it but don't hate it there. It's not a place I would want to go as top thing to do when in the area. Food is decent though.</text></sentence><sentence id="620"><text>The food was good BUT the service was terrible. There was no spoon for my coffee; they ran out of spoons they said. The waitresses aren't too friendly either. They were busy with their cell; texting and I had to wait a while for my coffee to be refilled. I was pretty much ignored for most of the lunch. Won't go again due to poor services. Also my home fries were burnt/dry. Other than that..the egg Benedict was good.</text></sentence><sentence id="621"><text>We went there with our 9 and 11 year old. We didn't feel too welcome at all by the manager because we bought our 2 girls with us who behaved very well and it felt too "upper class" to even go there with kids even if they are older. Not a place to go with kids even though kids are allowed. 

The lasagne was good but a bit burnt on top which I didn't like. The Alfredo pasta was flavourless. Not too good. Was disappointed that they had no pizza for a month when we went there. 

The waitress was sweet. But the manager ignored us and went for the people who looked like they had more money to spend and talked to them about the variety of wines. 

There was a sign when I came in that said something like no hats allowed or take off your hats. That was fine with me but a bit taken aback by that sign which kind of set the negative tone in a sense. 

Don't think I would go again because it felt like setting a foot in a stranger's house and felt awkward there. Food was good though but hard to enjoy myself.</text></sentence><sentence id="622"><text>My daughter and I are both picky about the sushi; she loves this place hands down so we only go here when the craving for sushi hits. The food is just amazing and delicious. My daughter often orders two plates of california rolls; her fave. Rice is good and food is just right. Not over or under cooked at all. I love their good prices; not even overpriced at all. :) The waitress was very sweet and nice. Hubs asked for extra pickled ginger and got that.</text></sentence><sentence id="623"><text>We live out of town and really just needed some place to watch our dog while we had lunch since it was too hot to leave him in the car. We decided to get him groomed and had a great experience. The staff was friendly and did a great job. The price was cheap compared to other places. They called when our dog was ready to be picked up and we told them we would be another 30 minutes until we could get there. That wasn't a problem!</text></sentence><sentence id="624"><text>This is a nice off-leash dog park. There are plenty of spots to sit while your pup plays. There's not a ton of shade which was fine for our visit in late October but I imagine it's miserable in the summer. The park is separated by weight. There was a third area not being used due to maintenance. My reviews is only 4/5 stars because it's kind of a small park. It certainly does the job though!</text></sentence><sentence id="625"><text>Took our 2 dogs for grooming here. While the groomer was nice he did an awful job. He had burnt the side of one of my dogs necks. There was burn scabs
For weeks afterwards. I let the groomer know, he apologized and said ill use a different Gaurd next time. We gave him another chance and this time the burn marks were even worse! He had two huge scabs on both sides of his neck. My dog was shaking the entire way home. I am not one to write reviews but had to in hopes that it might safe another dog having to go through this. I can't imagine how I'm gonna take him to another groomer, he's been traumatized.</text></sentence><sentence id="626"><text>I have been successfully treated by Dr. Xiao for 2 very different conditions.

1) I suffered a CTD / RSI hand/wrist injury due to my profession.  Rehabilitation doctors are not trained to detect minor amounts of inflammation and use a pain scale of 1-10 to quantify a patient's condition, or use expensive and uncomfortable diagnostic tests.  For a minor inflammatory condition, hand therapy and anti-inflammatory medicines were the prescribed course of action.  Unfortunately, a minor onset of more inflammation from overuse is not detectable by the hand therapist either, who is also trained with the pain scale.  Dr. Xiao is an expert detecting minor amounts of inflammation and could identify both where and how I sustained it.  She used a combination of deep tissue diagnosis and healing massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture to remove the inflammation.  

Now, I am working with both Dr. Xiao and the hand therapist to build muscle and function.  I have regained a tremendous amount of strength and am well on the way towards a full recovery.

2) I had a persistent skin irritation lasting over a year that my dermatologist could not identify and prescribed steriodal creams for.  Dr. Xiao recognized it right away as an energy imbalance in the liver channel.  She used a combination of herbal remedies and acupuncture and cleared it away permanently after 4 months of treatments.

She is easily one of the best diagnosticians and practitioners that I have ever met, and she truly loves her work.  I cannot say enough about how she has dramatically improved my life.</text></sentence><sentence id="627"><text>I had a vacant rental house with pet odor that a competitor carpet cleaner washed twice to eliminate the odor throughout all of the carpets.  Desperate not to have to do new carpeting, I found Spotless Carpet Care on the internet and called Steve.  He came over right away and knew exactly how to search for the problem spots using a black light (the prior cleaning company was not trained with this technique).  He found nothing on the surface, as the carpet had been previously washed but gave me a great deal to wash it on his own, as he had high confidence it would work.

When he came to clean, he was on time and very professional.  The cleaning was very thorough and brightened quite a bit, even after the previous cleanings.  I would definitely recommend him for pet owners or landlords that have to clean carpets after someone with pets leaves the property.</text></sentence><sentence id="628"><text>I called Just-In Time on Monday to see if they could move a very large china buffet to Goodwill.

I called David and he was incredibly helpful and sympathetic to my situation.  I bought a couple of gallons of paint and he made the most of the situation on a limited budget.  The house now looks fabulous and I will not hesitate to use him again!

Yes, I said permanent!  It's not just them, its their combination of great talent, compassion, and a top notch methodology (chiropractic biophysics).  I used to get migraine headaches 1-2x per month...other talented chiropractors would be able to alleviate the symptoms after onset, but then it would come back again in a few weeks.  Since treating at Pivonka Chiropractic,  I have had 2 in a year, and the severity has been much less than before.  I used to have swallowing problems...this has also all but disappeared.  My shoulders could not relax.  Now they do.  I was so impressed, I sent my entire family.

Well, $100 later I have AC! How did Advanced Auto come to the conclusion that my compressor was bad? I can never trust them after that. I will never go there again. Granite Reef Auto is great! They saved me $900. Advanced Auto was ready to take my $1000 and replace my already working compresdor. Shame on them. Really bad business!</text></sentence><sentence id="656"><text>I got the Burrito Phorrito. It was not good. My kids got the Stir Fry. They said it was ok, but we all ordered the slow roasted brisket for our meat choice and it was almost completely all fat. Couldn't even finish my burrito due to all the nasty fatty brisket.</text></sentence><sentence id="657"><text>Wow, walked in on a slow Sunday night. Sat at the bar for 8 minutes, there was nobody sitting near me, was totally ignored by the bartender. Got up and left. They would have easily made $50 from me. Worst service ever! I'll never go back.</text></sentence><sentence id="658"><text>The place is kind of filthy. I tried it 4 or 5 times. The last time the barber didn't even finish the haircut and yanked the cover so that the hairs that she cut fell all over my clothes. The old guy was okay the first couple of times I went there, but there's no guarantee who you get and in any case you come out feeling like you need a shower urgently.</text></sentence><sentence id="659"><text>Let me start off by saying this WAS my favorite Mexican spot in las Vegas. I drive from Southern Highlands just for the Pastor tacos! Usually I go late night but today I went in around 5 ish. Was greeted by the kitchen employees and when they asked what I wanted I nicely replied with "I need a few minutes". This man I never seen working there before said in Spanish a rude remark back to his coworkers about me saying I'm not ready yet. I was so offend, and he totally ruined my appetite so I left without ordering anything. Horrible experience for a loyal customer.</text></sentence><sentence id="660"><text>Really really cool place!  I got the shrimp over noodles dish, and my friend got beef over cattle.  Everything is so fresh and the atmosphere is awesome!  I'll definitely be back very soon!</text></sentence><sentence id="661"><text>This place is pretty cool.  I had a great time playing dodgeball with my son.  The foam pit is fun, but kind of gross when I think about it.  Sweaty kids just dive into it and I know those foam blocks are just soaking it all in.  Lol.  Overall tho, pretty fun time.  Trampoline dodgeball is awesome!</text></sentence><sentence id="662"><text>Great haircut!  Great experience.  You just have to try it.  They spend more time massaging, oiling and relaxing you're scalp, face, neck an shoulders than the actual haircut itself... And it's great!</text></sentence><sentence id="663"><text>This place was so cool looking!  Real dark with a moder/futuristic type feel with glowing blue lamps and crazy shaped decorations on the wall.  The Deluxe Burger was great and you get french fries in this little shopping car.  We got the 1/2 sweet potato 1/2 regular fries... great!  They even serve it with Fancy Sauce (Step Brothers reference.. but true story)!</text></sentence><sentence id="664"><text>awesome looking theatre!  I love the way it's laid out.  We went to watch a "Lead and Succeed" business seminar and it was cool.  Food is really overpriced though.</text></sentence><sentence id="665"><text>Awesome place... Just upset they took my salmon salad off the menu.  No more fish at all and that's what I like to eat when I'm out.  Their cookies and acai berry drink are awesome!</text></sentence><sentence id="666"><text>Lady was nice and did a good job on my sons hair.  My son is 6 and can be a pain in the butt with clippers.  She was done in 10 minutes too!  Only reason it's not a 5 star is because its just a haircut.  No cleanup or gel or anything after.  No water or cool amenities.  Worth the $7.99 I paid after coupon.</text></sentence><sentence id="667"><text>This place was awesome! I found out I had plantar fasciitis, which stinks since I have a 16 mile run to train for in November. Linda told me to come in and she'll take care of me. I was properly measured, asked a bunch of great questions and totally catered to. It was great. I got an awesome pair of new Nike running shoes that not only look really cool, but fit my feet perfectly. I also got an awesome set of running socks, inserts and a roller. They explained to me that I have tight calves, which can affect my feet the way it did. So, I got the roller to help break up the knots. I feel great and loved the experience. I'm not sure I'll ever just go to a Sports Authority again for sneakers. This was great!</text></sentence><sentence id="668"><text>These guys are awesome!  I referred them over to my cousin who was having a hard time renting his home.  Brian V. got with him and totally took care of him.  He got him more than the asking price for the monthly rent and everything was handled with the best of care.  Totally recommend these guys and will continue to do so!</text></sentence><sentence id="669"><text>Beautiful jewelery, great staff, great price.  They were so personal and took their time with me and got me very taken care of.  Totally recommend.</text></sentence><sentence id="670"><text>Amazing catering company!  Their lasagna and 3 layer cookies are just like my mom made when I was younger!  Awesome!</text></sentence><sentence id="671"><text>Pretty cool place.  Because I checked in and got 15% off for doing so, I am switching my 4 star to a 5 star.  The food was great and I love places that give yelpers a deal!</text></sentence><sentence id="672"><text>Get the green tacos!  Atmosphere is great!  I don't think ill ever bowl at an amc again!  Spoiled!</text></sentence><sentence id="673"><text>This place was so much fun!  The band was absolutely amazing.  The ONLY reason they didn't get a 5th star, was because I asked the hostess a few days beforehand if there was dancing, and she said "yes, the band is awesome and they move the tables out so people can dance."  The band WAS definitely amazing, but everyone kind of just stood there and my wife wanted to dance on her bday.  Other than that.... awesome!</text></sentence><sentence id="674"><text>Not a bad place.  Not a great place.  The price awards this a 4 star because it IS a really great value.  Churros and quesadillas were pretty awesome.</text></sentence><sentence id="675"><text>AccountingProse are amazing!  It's so good to meet a bookkeeper that actually understands 1) technology and 2) that the goal should always be to make things easier for the client... not for them.  My experience has been amazing so far and I'm so glad to have started with them!</text></sentence><sentence id="676"><text>Been coming here for years!  Russ is the man and his barbers are solid.  Haven't seen fades and service like this since NYC.  Great people.  Never leaving.</text></sentence><sentence id="677"><text>Really nice people.  The food is ok.  I thought it would be better.  Everyone's taste in Italian food is different though</text></sentence><sentence id="678"><text>The people here are really nice.  We like coming here.  I wish they had a better "health" section.  It's pretty small.</text></sentence><sentence id="679"><text>Really cool boxing gym.  Would have gotten 5 star if they had longer hours and better weekend hours.  Other than that... It's really clean, staff is cool and the classes and instructors are awesome!  If u don't wok out late at night... You'll find this place a 5 star</text></sentence><sentence id="680"><text>Wow... talk about the absolute WORST company I've ever tried to do business with.  It does NOT get much worse than these guys.  First... a little background, I have never gone out of my way to complain about a company.  If you see my other reviews, you'll notice I go out of my way to rave about companies on here.  There's only 1 other negative review in my portfolio, and even that company is 4 stars compared to crappy old Appliance Certified.  

I used these guys about a year ago, and the guy that came over was cool and the price was reasonable.  So I actually referred them to about 3 people since and kept their magnet on my fridge. 

However, last week my sink started leaking and we were unable to use it anymore until fixed.  I called this company right away (Thursday) to book appt for the next day (Friday).  No call... no show.  I called back later in the day simply to leave a voicemail.  Saturday I called back and they said they'd have someone out Monday (after apologizing).  Monday came... no call... no show.  Typically, I know you should give up on a poor company like this.  But, I decided to give them one more chance.  Called Tuesday, and set up for today because I had a busy week and couldn't do it until that Friday.  Next Friday came, they called me at 9am to confirm.  Whew... then... didn't show.  1pm I called them and a woman said she'd get on the phone with dispatcher and call me back right away with an ETA.  3 hours later... no call... no show.  I called now twice only to leave another message. 

Bottom line:  This company shouldn't even be called a company.  The suck.  My 5 year old son is more responsible and considerate. If I had nothing else to do today, I would create 3 more Yelp accounts just so I can complain 3 more times.  One for every time they messed up.</text></sentence><sentence id="681"><text>Nice place. A lot of fruit options, which I like.  People have been there forever, too!</text></sentence><sentence id="682"><text>nice place.  They had a great guitar player that we listened to while having a drink for my wife's birthday.</text></sentence><sentence id="683"><text>pretty awesome place.

Wow!</text></sentence><sentence id="687"><text>wow!  such a beautiful place!  from the golf course to the bars and outside patio, it's great.  We went there for Infusioncon and it was awesome!</text></sentence><sentence id="688"><text>This place has been my favorite restaurant for 10 years.  It's amazing!  I always get the Mediterranean Calamari and oysters on half shell... But truthfully... Everything is awesome!  5 star!  Highly recommend if u enjoy seafood!</text></sentence><sentence id="689"><text>Came here with my 2 year old daughter for our first date last night.  Halfway through the movie she got tired ad wanted to go home and when the front desk saw us leave, she asked if everything was ok.

Pretty cool place.</text></sentence><sentence id="691"><text>pretty cool place.  kind of annoyed that we were told they'd lower the hoop for my 6 year old son, then when we got there they said they couldn't do it.

The monkeys and giraffe where the best!</text></sentence><sentence id="693"><text>I met the owners through facebook and got to hear what a lot of their fans/friends/clients say about them.

We are definitely using them for our next move and are referring them to anybody we find!  Great recommendation!</text></sentence><sentence id="694"><text>Really nice people and clean, slick looking bank.  Making the switch from Chase wasn't as easy as we promised, but they did try to make up for it.  I recommend joining.</text></sentence><sentence id="695"><text>Been going here for 3 years.  Great gym.  Other than a pool they have everything u need!  Because of the no pool, I was going to give them a 4 star.  However, because they give yelpers an awesome deal by awarding them with a free smoothie and tan if they check in... It will be a 5 star!</text></sentence><sentence id="696"><text>Great cuts!  Vadim is really good.  Got me to come back!</text></sentence><sentence id="697"><text>This place is ok.  Cool atmosphere and the dishes taste pretty good.

Get the Ecuadorean tamales and seco de pollo!  Apple soda is great too!

PS:  Expect slower service, because it is TRULY mom and pop.  If you go in with this attitude, you'll really enjoy the experience.  If you want quick, timely servers that ask you how food is every 30 seconds, you may want to try Olive Garden or something.</text></sentence><sentence id="711"><text>Great little atmosphere to work or meet with people.  I'm not a big coffee guy, so can't tell u if that's good or not.  But, I enjoyed it and the place just has a great feel to it!</text></sentence><sentence id="712"><text>I searched high and low for a good salon near me (even driving out to Glendale &amp; Peoria) and found exactly what I was looking for at Chace Salon thorugh Christina.  Christina's the best, use her and you'll have no regrets!  You can simply explain what you want to her and she'll figure out how do cut and style so that it complements your features!

And the price is beyone reasonable for a great hair cut!</text></sentence><sentence id="713"><text>I had my big olde english sheepdog groomed here and they did a fine job and the price was on par with everyone else. Actually I think the price is about $10 more, but I'll pay the extra money because of the extra service this place provides.

I really appreciate that they have a pet taxi, bc of this service my dog gets a ride home for free (but we did tip the driver). Since I have a little child it's hard for me to bring my dog and pick him up on the days I would have time to pick him up, so the taxi is worth it for me. Bc of this service I can now drop off my dog before I go to work and my husband (on days he's caring for my daughter) can be home to let my dog inside. This is easier for me than having to bring my 100+ dog inside while holding my baby.

Shauna's is right next to Mountainside Fitness, it's right in Surprise so if you live in Surprise this place will be easy to get to. 

I also thought the service was great too. I'll definitely be taking my dog back here the next time he needs to get groomed.</text></sentence><sentence id="714"><text>Best sandwiches I've had in a long time! And they'll deliver--if you fall in their small delivery zone-- 1 sandwich to you. This comes in handy for me while I'm at work and hungry! 

I love the bread &amp; their mayo. YUM! I usually order the beach club. No complaints from me!</text></sentence><sentence id="715"><text>I joined this gym after leaving Fitness 1. This gym isn't perfect but is as close to perfect as I could ask for. 

I like the long hours the gym provides for daycare. And daycare will change dirty diapers!!! And for the most part I really do like the gym daycare employees (except I had an experience where the daycare manager was extremely rude, but I forgave that one instance because I figured she was having a bad day).

I also enjoy the towel service. &amp; The equipment is great. The classes seem great though I have yet to attend a class. 

But I wish the gym would add free wifi for members to use while working out (so that I can watch netflix while working out), add some more channels to the equipment's tvs (I wish they would add e, bravo, mtv) and add a laundry shoot for towels inside the locker rooms. I even put in a request for the laundry shoot but Mountainside obviously just ignored my request. 

I also wish this location &amp; all other locations would have a water service that they provide in their Scottsdale location. It seems like the west valley is constantly getting the short end of the stick and this is another example of that isn't it? &amp; might be wrong but I think the Scottsdale location also has better tv channels than the Surprise gym does.

But despite those gripes I'm still a fan. This is the best gym in Surprise.</text></sentence><sentence id="716"><text>I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars if I could. Because to me, this place isn't blow your socks off delicious! Instead it's just good enough. 

Look, when I'm craving pho I'm glad I have a place close by to order from, however it's just not as good as I'm used to back home. I think my problem is it doesn't taste as authentic as I'm used to. This place to me seems like it's trying to be asian fusion (like Pei Wei or PF Changs) when I just want pho nothing fancy just pho.

Though I did think the spring rolls were awesome!!!

But nonetheless it does fulfil my cravings without me having to drive 45 minutes, so I'm happy about that!</text></sentence><sentence id="717"><text>I love it here!

But you really need to order the all you can eat because the portions on the plate of meat are too little for the amount you're paying.  The all you can eat is around $25 / person &amp; everyone at your table has to eat all you can eat or no one can order it. If you order the all you can eat then you don't have to pay extra for rice (which you really shouldn't have to do if you put in an order for meat--but that's just my opinion).

Seoul Grill recently revised their menu, so there are more options for different meats. They have added different flavors, which are so yummy! Try to spicy pork belly (sam gyop sal) that was recently added it's one of my favorites.

And remember when eating meat first order not marinated meats then order marinated because otherwise the marinated meats taste will disrupt the taste of the not marinated meat.   

I must say it's really nice not having to drive to Koreatown for a decent korean bbq place!

Oh and all the people who work here are so nice &amp; helpful! I wish they would make a Seoul Grill in Surprise! We need a korean restaurant in Surprise!</text></sentence><sentence id="718"><text>I'm so glad I found this salon!!! After getting my hair burned last year &amp; then finding out that Hair City in Phoenix closed I wasn't sure where to go to get my hair magic straightened. I even debated driving out to LA to get my hair done in Koreatown.

But luckily I received a referral to Cleo's from a Korean restaurant and so I went here and am glad I did!

I got my hair magic straightened (aka japanese straightened) and the stylist did a great job. Although my hair didn't come out perfectly, I blame myself because I recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair. And bleach plus magic will frizz hair. I learned this from the stylist at Cleo.

I have to give extra credit to the stylist at Cleo, because he kept asking me if I had used bleach in my hair for highlights. And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.)

I also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year)

Go here get your hair done by an expert. He told me he was trained in both Korea &amp; Japan. So he speaks Korean, Japanese, &amp; English. 

I believe magic straight costs about $150, at least that's what I paid. And digital perm costs around $130</text></sentence><sentence id="719"><text>I'm always complaining about the lack of customer service in Arizona, but if you go to Pleasure Paradise Salon you will NOT have any customer service complaints!  Believe you me!

I also had the best massage by Kimber. I'm always having neck / upper back pain because of stress &amp; taking care of a young baby but Kimber gave my upper back so much attention that I finally found relief in my back. 

And everyone from was so nice! One stop shop for hair, body, &amp; nail care!</text></sentence><sentence id="720"><text>Helen's was terrible.  I got magic straight at Helens I think I paid $150 ish and she did not know what she was doing.  &amp; kept blaming me, and kind of made me feel stupid my korean was not on par with hers.  

Then when I called to tell her it didn't come out she had me come in again.  Attempted it again but given she doesn't know what she's doing obviously it didn't come out.  

She also laughed when I asked her to cut my white husband's hair.  Told me to go to a white salon.  I thought she was really rude.  Hair city is waaaaay better.  623) 847-0308

Hair city has on multiple occasions successfully straightened my hair (hair city did give me a funky hair cut once)</text></sentence><sentence id="721"><text>Best insurance agency!

It's nice going to a repair shop that I trust isn't taking advantage of me! And it's nice walking in and speaking to the owners. Great customer service! 

Every time I go to one of those other repair shops they come up with a list of stuff to fix -- and when I check in with my father in law or friends they tell me those repairs are not necessary for my vehicles!

Go here and you can trust what Mike &amp; Kelly say!</text></sentence><sentence id="723"><text>I've been a member here for 4 or 5 years.  I only pay $9 / month and the gym had everything I need... that is until I had a baby.  Look you know what you're getting at this gym.  It's kind of a no frills but cheap gym that's clean enough. So it worked for me during these past years.

the daycare hours that the gym are ok but the daycare workers don't change a baby's dirty diapers and instead page the parent which is disruptive to a workout.  Also the daycare hours (for me) don't start early enough.  So I'm sad to say I'm going to be switching to another gym probably at the new year.  

But I did enjoy working out at Fitness during the past 4/5 years.  And all the gym workers are so nice and quick to help out with any billing issues (of which I have had too many!).  So I am sad to be switching.  But need to so that I can work out around my &amp; my baby's schedules.</text></sentence><sentence id="724"><text>Went here to celebrate my anniversary. Food was good. But not lick the bowl clean good. 

For the amount of money we spent I think we could have done better. But the meal was fine. Service was great. 

Dessert is to die for. Pound cake &amp; chooclate fondue. Enough said! 

I agree with other posters who suggest just going for dessert. The food isn't worth the price.</text></sentence><sentence id="725"><text>This used to be my favorite nail salon in Surprise.  But I think they changed ownership (in fact I saw that they changed ownership-- at least that's what they're advertising in the Surprise weekly).  

Anyway, I received a white tip pedi from a new tech (female).  She did not paint even  lines.  And when I looked at my toes the lines were a mess and did not match one another.  Some were lower, some were shorter.  It's hard to explain but  my toes did not resemble one another.  I asked if she could fix the lines.  And she had to redo the lines and still couldn't get it right.

Look, getting a pedicure is a service and I want it to look nice.  And the fact I'm paying extra for the white tip... I feel like they should get it right.

I've been getting pedicures for years and have never complained.  

Anyway, it was obvious I wasn't happy, the manager(?) Kevin came and looked at my pedi and told me it looked fine to him.  They know me at this salon.  I think even if they thought I was imagining the concerns (which I was not) I think they should have had another tech redraw the lines or comp something to make me feel valued.  Instead they made me feel worthless as a customer by telling me there was nothing wrong.

So I got upset, passed on the manicure, paid for the pedicure and left.

I've been going to this nail salon for years, I think 2 years.  They know me at this salon.  And to question me when I'm upset about something just doesn't make me happy.  

I'm not going back to this salon.</text></sentence><sentence id="726"><text>I've had 3 treatments so far from Sabrina and love it. Her prices are great &amp; she's super nice &amp; attentive to boot!

We tried it out, and let me tell you, it was awesome. Their portions were just right, and even though I was full when we left, I didn't feel gross like I do at other restaurants. I had the BBQ chicken pizza, and I loved it. Thin, flatbread crust made for a light pizza, very tasty pizza. My wife had the chicken Caesar salad. She gets that salad so often that she knows her Caesars, and she said this was her favorite dressing. And the chicken of course was amazing as well.</text></sentence><sentence id="730"><text>I've been to see Dr. Tom Nguyen for the past few years.  He explains things clearly, he's friendly and is willing to take the time to answer questions.  He does the cleaning himself, which means that you get more time with your dentist.  The cleanings have always been free of any significant pain (as little discomfort as a trip to the dentist can be, anyway!).  He has never suggested any costly/unnecessary procedures (which I'd recently heard can happen), and I'm glad that he noticed some gum recession and suggested that I see a periodontist to prevent problems in the future.  Appointments have always been easy to get.  All in all, a great dentist!</text></sentence><sentence id="731"><text>Hirut is great.  Delicious food, friendly staff, a down-to-earth feel.

I haven't been for any live events, but I love the idea that they do this.</text></sentence><sentence id="732"><text>I am giving 4 stars for the coffee, otherwise it would only be three. My croissant tasted dry and as if it was made a few days ago. However, I could tell it was yummy. I find it very difficult to find a good cup of coffee out of my house and neighborhood, since we are spoiled in the Bay Area. Sure enough, they actually use a Bay Area roaster (Equator) and it was great and quite the relief!</text></sentence><sentence id="733"><text>I rarely leave reviews. That being said I have to let the world know that Ciarra not only gave me the best facial I have ever had. She also managed to make me relax enough to enjoy it! I have a hard time relaxing. Her amazing personality put me right at ease. You can tell right off the get go she knows what she is doing and she is a beautiful person!</text></sentence><sentence id="734"><text>We ordered the 2 fish combo and fish burrito. I found the best idem to be their cocktail sauce. Over priced. Small portions.</text></sentence><sentence id="735"><text>We went there on our anniversary this year on December 6 th .I was concerned after reading the reviews from different sights .wow! We're we happy we ignored them . excellent service and the food was perfect Miriam( I think was our servers name ) and she was fantastic .I did feel the prices were high or should I say  higher than I want to pay .but the lady has put up with me for 48 yrs.so I think she deserved it .the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the prices .</text></sentence><sentence id="736"><text>What a great spot and atmosphere! Oh and their beer is some of the best AZ stuff around! Can't wait to day drink there.</text></sentence><sentence id="737"><text>I am in love with this place. Today was my first time and we need one in Tucson immediately! 

The parking lot was packed and just as I was about to get irritated I noticed there is complimentary valet service. Que  fancy! 

The inside is super casual and clean and the staff was awesome! We didn't get to sit outside in the crazy cool and dog friendly patio. I saw a dog sitting on the a table outside! 

I ordered from the $10 brunch menu. Food plus 10oz beer or mimosa. I had the breakfast wrap, the wife had the breakfast flat bread. I recommend both. My girls had chicken tenders which were actual chicken with a tasty fried covering. They loved their food too. 

If you have kids, a dog, and hankering for good food you owe it to yourself to come here.</text></sentence><sentence id="738"><text>This place has 2 sandwiches cheese steak and cheese chicken! There are some small eats for kiddos but you owe it to yourself to stop here after a long IKEA hike. The bread is what seals the deal for me. 
I had the chicken with cheese whiz and buffalo sauce. #nailedit! 

The staff was also crazy nice! No five stars only because I thought they served other types of sandwiches too.</text></sentence><sentence id="739"><text>A must stop on your way back from Vegas! 

I had the huevos rancheros with their signature green chili and pork. So good! The portion to price ratio was a nice return to normal coming from the land of a $10 beer on the strip 30 minutes away. The eggs were cooked just right and the pork green chili was smothered over the fried tortillas and beans. If you like green chili and solid breakfast food you have to take the very quick detour into the historic downtown area. 

I'm sure there is a wait almost every weekend but that will give you some time to do some antiquing. 

I'll definitely be going back!</text></sentence><sentence id="740"><text>This theatre is the ultimate splurge!  From the comfy recliners complete with blanket and pillow (in the premium seating) to the fantastic wait staff you couldn't ask for a more luxurious way to watch a movie.  Being able to book online and have reserved seats is very convenient.  Yeah, it's expensive (total of $250 for premium seating and dinner for 5-no alcohol involved) but is worth it for a nice evening out with friends once in awhile!</text></sentence><sentence id="741"><text>Bought a used beetle at a dealer out of state and had a small problem with it on the way home.  Called San Tan VW service department the next day and was pleasantly surprised how friendly the people were on the phone.  I took the vehicle there the same day and was greeted by Jeff Aguilar in service who looked at the car and called me within the hour with the diagnosis.  The next day, the car was ready, fixed right and freshly washed. They even worked with the dealer in California that I bought the car from for payment.  I will be bringing the car back for regular maintenance without hesitation.  Thanks and keep up the good work!</text></sentence><sentence id="742"><text>Went tonight for a quick dinner which turned out to be over an hour.  Nice decor, very clean but the very slow service (40min wait for our entrees) was way too long.  Never saw the waitress again after we placed the order until it was time for the check.  When the food arrived, it was only lukewarm and despite my attempt to flag down a waiter to refill our drinks, we were basically ignored.  Can't see this place lasting any longer than the other places that have been it this location, will not return.</text></sentence><sentence id="743"><text>Called Adam to tint my VW beetle.  He called back immediately with a quote and even beat the current Groupon price, plus he comes to you which made the deal even sweeter.  The car came out fantastic and he cleaned up all the overspray and left the car cleaner than it was.  Highly recommended! Thanks again Adam.</text></sentence><sentence id="744"><text>Kudos to Charlotte Motor Speedway!! They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!! Way to go CMS even though we regularly attend races here you now have a customer for life!</text></sentence><sentence id="745"><text>I have eaten here quite a few times and the food is good. The 2 stars is because they no longer have limes!(trying to get a response) I ordered a margarita (ultimate which was very good) and when I asked for a lime the bartender said they had stopped ordering them because they were too expensive! Now granted this didn't make or break my meal but that was one of the strangest things I have heard. It wasn't like it was $2 margarita night ($9 to be exact) Hopefully someone in management will see this and respond. If you like a lime with your margarita or your Mexican beer you may want to pass until they they make a better business decision</text></sentence><sentence id="746"><text>We are regulars but tonight we tried Korean short ribs which were amazing!  If you haven't tried this place the sushi and everything else is so good!</text></sentence><sentence id="747"><text>Had the Lobster with pasta a la carte - $45ish. 

It was the best pasta lobster dish I have ever had - period. I am Italian and have been eating homemade pasta for years.  This rivals my great-grandmothers cooking.</text></sentence><sentence id="748"><text>My midway nissan review. This place is not honest.  My experience with them is that they will not honor their commitment to you.  Don't shop here. They are liars!</text></sentence><sentence id="749"><text>First Choice provided Jesus and Gustavo. They were very professional and careful. Thanks Guys -- you were awesome!</text></sentence><sentence id="750"><text>Terrible customer service.  Was looking to buy an Evoque.  The salesman was totally arrogant  and the Sales Manager wouldn't budge on the quoted price even though I could get the same car in Scottsdale Az for 2K less.  I just wanted an extra 500 off - nothing crazy.  I was basically told that they know they are the only game in town - only Land Rover dealer for hundreds of miles and I was just going to have to take it or leave it.  After getting totally pissed and deciding that I'll just buy the car and get screwed on a bad deal they tell me that it is getting late (Saturday 4PM) and that even if I buy the car - right now - they can't delivery it to me today because they don't have enough time.  I'll have to wait till next week to get the car I am standing right in front of.  What!!!  What kind of low budget garbage is that?  

I've never tried so hard to give someone 54K.  I'm done with these guys.  Taking my business and money somewhere else. What a joke.</text></sentence><sentence id="751"><text>Food was good.  Prices were less than Jen's across the street and the meat portions were bigger.  We got 2 salad rolls and 2 orders of B6, beef, pork, chicken, and spingroll, with veggies.  Paid $35 after tip and left full!

Will be coming back!</text></sentence><sentence id="752"><text>Food came too quick, meatballs were still cold inside, jambalaya wasnt quite hot.  They forgot to ring in the appetizer  Service was ok, nothing more.  It was pasta tuesday, moderatly busy.  I like the deal on tuesday so we keep coming here hoping for improvement, so far it hasnt happened.</text></sentence><sentence id="753"><text>Perfect job! We hired kaleidoscope to paint our entire house - baseboards, trim, doors, walls, ceilings. It looks awesome and perfect! And they finished early. We will definitely hire them again.</text></sentence><sentence id="754"><text>The vet took the time to explain what was possibly going on with my dog. Staff was friendly. Pricing was good. I will be going back for my vet needs in the future.</text></sentence><sentence id="755"><text>First time here and the ice cream was excellent and very cold due to that it's made by liquid nitrogen.

My first drink is Vietnamese coffee Boba milk tea...super good!</text></sentence><sentence id="757"><text>I went to see Dr. Steven Folkerth for a routine physical. The receptionist was unfriendly. The doctor gave me a prescription for blood tests and Vit D test.

I went to do the tests the same day. After waiting for about 2 weeks and I did not hear from Dr. Steven Folkerth about the result of my tests. I called his office and the receptionist said she has the result in. I went in to pick up a copy of the tests and the receptionist was still unfriendly. I saw that my triglycerides was above normal range and that the Vit D test was missing from the report. I asked the receptionist to locate my Vit D report and she said she is going to give me a call next day. I waited and she never call. I called her and she said she is going to get back to me. It has been 10 days since I talked to her and she never called me back. I am missing a vital part of the test because my Vit D level was low from a previous test. I understand Vit D is very important for my daily health. I got a run around. The doctor or the receptionist never contact me about my high triglycerides and missing test.

I am very disappointed from the people in this office.</text></sentence><sentence id="758"><text>This by far THE best sushi in the valley. No joke, everything is to die for! The sushi chefs are amazing. I like to sit at the bar here even though I usually opt for a table elsewhere. Their menu of specialty rolls is a bit intimidating I admit but, just let them know what you like and they'll make excellent recommendations. I must say, the sauces are beyond anything I've ever tasted. If it were socially acceptable, I would pick up the plate and lick it clean. I'm not exaggerating, they're heavenly perfection and unlike no other.
Please be aware there are no prices on the menu. Apparently it changes based on market fish prices and it can be a bit pricey. If I lived closer I'd be there all the time, seriously. No matter where you live, it's absolutely worth it!</text></sentence><sentence id="759"><text>Amazing! They have lunch specials everyday, not just M-F. The Sunshine Roll is pure heaven, in fact, I can't stop thinking about it. The sushi is super fresh and beautifully presented. Cute place, great sushi, awesome service, I'm totally hooked!</text></sentence><sentence id="760"><text>This place is awesome! I love Mexican food and I'm so glad I found this place. The blackened chicken quesadilla is sooo good, they give you tons of sour cream and delicious guacamole to enjoy it with. The chips/salsa/guacamole side is a must order. They're portions are fantastic, their food is consistently delicious, and they have my favorite frothy pina colada drink. I really couldn't ask for more, I love you Habaneros ;)</text></sentence><sentence id="761"><text>I love this place! Pho is one of my favorite dishes and I tried many other Vietnamese resturants before finding this gem. Now, I don't go anywhere else because Noodles Ranch is the best. Excellent food, fresh quality ingredients, great service. I feel great after eating here, not at all sluggish. The spring rolls are amazing, we usually get a few orders. The jasmine iced tea is fantastic. The owners are sweet and passionate about their business, they even have a cookbook out and available for purchase there.</text></sentence><sentence id="762"><text>Pat is truly an artist! I love what she does to my hair, not to mention the way I feel after she works her magic. Her cuts are perfection, her highlights stunningly gorgeous. Whatever it is you want she can give it to you. Pat is experienced, talented, and knows how to make you look good. I even referred a guy friend to her who was frustrated after receiving mediocre cuts all around town. Needless to say, his hair looks great and with minimal effort which he loves. Also, this is my favorite Ulta, everyone is friendly and helpful.</text></sentence><sentence id="763"><text>I love 5 &amp; Diner! The cherry cokes, the mac 'n' cheese, Mrs. Cleaver's pot roast (no longer on the menu but you can still order it), the diner grilled chicken sandwich, and the most delicious root beer floats &amp; shakes! Being a classic movie fan, of course I love the atmosphere and photos of movie stars that adorn the walls. Plus, some nights they have live rockabilly music and people bring their cool, classic cars. How awesome is that? There's no where else like this in Scottsdale. Oh yes and the service is excellent too!</text></sentence><sentence id="764"><text>Worst food and service ever. My boyfriend took one bite of their so called steak sandwich and said dog food. My boyfriend is nicer than I am. Seriously, I doubt my cat would've eaten it. What really got me however was the fact that when we politely informed the staff we were questioned 3 times about why it wasn't good. Now, I could have been straight up honest and flat out rude about it but it not our style. The man who questioned us could have been a manager but since he never identified himself he could have been anyone. I suggest the zipps staff eat it themselves and find out exactly why it's worthy of sending back. Don't bother when in the same complex there are truly excellent places to spend your money.</text></sentence><sentence id="765"><text>I love this place, great service and amazingly delicious Chinese food. The sweet n sour chicken is my favorite. I've never had it better and I've eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants. I also love the vegetable fried rice, lemon chicken, and wonton soup. I've seen reviews that are unfavorable and to each his own but, really? I don't know what the hell they're talking about. This place rocks and does so consistently.</text></sentence><sentence id="766"><text>Ethical and mechanic don't always go together, as anyone who's been scammed can attest. So, needless to say I am so happy I found Al at brakemasters! Trustworthy, honest, and friendly. I will not take my car anywhere else. I highly recommend Al to all my friends and fellow yelpers who are in need of car repairs or routine maintenance. If this location isn't near you, trust me, it's worth the drive.</text></sentence><sentence id="767"><text>This place is awesome! A friend recommended it years ago and I'm so glad she did. The chicken salad sandwich is heavenly, a must try. Everything is fresh and delicious. This place is family owned and operated. They are super friendly people who remember you and make you feel welcome. Oh and did I mention to try the chicken salad? There's nothing like it anywhere, I love it and I'm sure you will too. Do make sure to bring cash as they dont accept anything else.</text></sentence><sentence id="768"><text>Oh Sushi Kee, how I love thee! I've been coming here for years ever since a friend recommended it. Im glad she did because they have awesome rolls. My favorites are the Arizona, Hurricane, Tiger, Kee, Salmon Avacodo, and the California rolls are the best! The portions are huge, the service and Chefs are awesome. I wish I lived closer so I could come here more often.</text></sentence><sentence id="769"><text>This is my go to Petco. It's close, convenient, and the staff are super friendly and helpful. I love being a pals rewards member since I get a $5 off coupon for every $100 I spend in store or online. They carry the brands I prefer, like Blue Buffalo and Dr. Elsey's (best kitty food and litter ever btw) and have sales often. Also, the fish are well cared for and healthy. I love that they do pet adoptions and give you an option to donate to animals in need. Kudos to Petco, I hope I always live close to this location.</text></sentence><sentence id="770"><text>Love this place! Authentic, fresh and delicioso! I totally pig out whenever I go here. The carne asada street tacos are amazing, excellent nachos, yummy salsas. Friendly atmosphere and great prices, what's not to love? If you're looking for real Mexican food, go here, you won't be disappointed. A big thank you to my fellow Yelpers, another great find via your awesome reviews :)</text></sentence><sentence id="771"><text>Had a very enjoyable time at Vintage95 last Saturday night. The wait staff was top notch and very accommodating. Very comfortable atmosphere and furnishings. The young woman paying guitar was excellent ... wonderful renditions of a Roberta Flack and Cranberries tunes, among others. Looking forward to going back and sampling the single malts they have.
5 Stars for my date too!</text></sentence><sentence id="772"><text>The #22 Dinner Combo (String Bean in Black Bean Sauce w/ Shrimp) was the best black bean sauce I've had since leaving NY. Now, if they only had Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce  ;-), Looking forward to going back and trying their Singapore Style Mei Fun and other specialities.</text></sentence><sentence id="773"><text>Great food and service! Came here for a special occasion. Large variety of food on the menu! Will come again :)</text></sentence><sentence id="774"><text>I'm mostly reiterating what other have said but with a few additions.

General
- Bad ventilation. With Pittsburgh humidity, it gets hot.
- Wooden walls, so there's not a lot of grip for smearing
= Price for a day pass is reasonable, but fees for little things like a belay device and chalk add up instead of holding an id for collateral.

Bouldering area
+ Decent number of routes and variety
- Stiff trampoline floor. Movable pads are big and effective but they aren't everywhere

Top rope area
-The top rope area is a different section of the building and even has different hours from the bouldering area, which is weird.
- Ratings are labeled as Easy, Moderate, and Hard with +/-. Why not put real YDS ratings?
- For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before.
- Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.  Discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in San Francisco where I live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating.</text></sentence><sentence id="775"><text>We weren't planning on visiting here but saw a billboard (they work!) saying Jerry Seinfeld was on that night and we just couldn't miss out that opportunity!

So we ended up with seats towards the back but the view was still great along with the acoustics. Would make for a great venue to see some live acts in as well.</text></sentence><sentence id="776"><text>To be honest at first I didn't want to stay here as it seemed like it might be a bit 'tacky' but after being recommended by a few good friends we decided to book in as part of our US trip for 3 nights.

How wrong I was! Upon entering the driveway it was just 'wow' all of the way. The reception was massive and they had plenty of staff ready to book you in. The only one downside was that we had to go into a smoking room which did have some smell left to it but was gone in a matter of hours and reception did tell us we could change later that afternoon if it was still bad.

The room was very spacious and the bathroom was huge. The resort is massive and trust me it will take you some time to explore. The gym had a great setup and has plenty of equipment- no waiting like at the gym back home!

We gave the buffet a go and just like everyone said it's a must visit. They make just about anything there and have heaps of options to choose from.

All up well worth the stay and couldn't believe the price compared to other hotels in the USA.

ps. the blinds in the room operate by a switch - we spent a while trying to force them open haha!</text></sentence><sentence id="777"><text>I read a lot of reviews about this buffet so on our last day I made sure to drop in as we were staying at the Bellagio.

Oh. My. God. This place was awesome! Not only did it have the widest choice of options I have ever seen at a buffet, the quality and presentation was like a top restaurant!

Highly recommend going here if you're after a good feed. Plenty of healthy choices as well but I must admit I gave in to quite a few of those tasty pastries... :)</text></sentence><sentence id="778"><text>Nice casual bar located in the Aria hotel. To be honest I went here thinking it actually had a view across the city! Still a good find and it's a nice open bar with plenty of seating and some great drinks.

Just a word of warning the free snack include wasabi peas... didn't realise what they were at first but they made us go through our drinks pretty quick when we did!</text></sentence><sentence id="779"><text>Great spot for a quick treat if you're staying at the Bellagio. We had some of the pastries which tasted fresh and like something straight from a bakery.

The only downside was that the cafe was positioned on our walk back from the pool to the lifts.. ;)</text></sentence><sentence id="780"><text>Outside seating that's truly different!

As we were only in Vegas for a few nights we wanted to make sure we got to experience as much as possible - including the dining. After doing the usual hunt on Yelp we decided to try out Spago and it was a great suggestion.

When we arrived the waiter asked if we wanted sit inside or out and we opted to go outside - best choice! To be honest I thought the blue ceiling was tacky at first but after a while it really started to trick you that you were outside!

The food was awesome (as expected) but the service from the waiters was top notch as well. Highly recommend.</text></sentence><sentence id="781"><text>Our last night in Vegas and we wanted to make sure to finish off with a great meal and Bouchon delivered!

Not only were the meals great but the dessert we had was sooo good as well. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for something a bit different and a great atmosphere.</text></sentence><sentence id="782"><text>Never being to a Cirque du Soleil before I didn't know fully what to expect but judging by what everyone else had told me, it would be an amazing show.

Happy to say it was superb and I'll be certain to see another if I get the chance! It was amazing to see the skills of the performers and it was a great mix of acrobatics, theatre and comedy.

Looking forward to the next one!</text></sentence><sentence id="783"><text>We always love our Italian food so I couldn't resist checking out this place when we were inside Wynn checking out the casino.

It was a great find and the decor inside was executed perfectly! The staff we really quick to serve us and the meals came out really quick. We had asked for a white sauce instead of the tomato for one of our meals which they got wrong but were very apologetic and came out just as quick with another one for us.

All up a great meal and find in such a great casino.</text></sentence><sentence id="784"><text>Worth it just for the view.

We only went up to visit the lounge. One big downside was the cover charge ($20 each!) that we weren't expecting but we just treated it as an entry fee as if going to a viewing deck ;)

The drinks were nice and the bar was starting to get a bit busier as we got there. But the main thing we went for (the view) was well worth it - especially at night looking right across the light beam coming from the pyramid below.</text></sentence><sentence id="785"><text>We had been recommended Pink Jeep from some friends of ours and we're really thankful they did!

The trip was well organised with them picking us up from the hotel and then heading out to the Canyon. Our driver gave us some great commentary on the way out and had the perfect balance of not talking the whole time but still being really informative.

We stopped at a few spots on the way out including Hoover Dam and a small store for a rest stop which made the trip out there feel even more authentic going into an actual country store.

We didn't realise when we got there that we would all be going onto buses afterwards but the guide was really good at making sure we all had the freedom of looking around each lookout and then still grouping back together at the end.

Thanks for making it an easy and great trip!</text></sentence><sentence id="786"><text>This place is a must visit for anyone to Las Vegas!

I'm so thankful I came across it on here as it was never suggested to us by anyone else or even at the hotel we were staying. You start off the tour at their meeting spot where they give you plenty of water and warnings about just how hot it can get in there so be careful!

We got to meet our tour guide as well who gave us a quick background on the non-profit organisation behind the museum - it's great to see such a dedicated group of people preserving what some people would just treat as junk.

It's an amazing collection of old signage and as part of the tour around the 'boneyard' the guide gave us some great (and humorous) history about Las Vegas.
 This really made the tour as there was so much we learnt at the same time and it was astonishing to learn just how much the city has changed.

If you like your photography this place is an absolute must visit. There's so many good opportunities as the place is full of so much colour and typography.

Stop reading my review and book in now! :)</text></sentence><sentence id="787"><text>Roast beef was amazing that sandwich alone will bring me back again before I leave Vegas.  I didn't care for the pizza I've had better.  But that sandwich was easily one of the best I've had.  I ordered a pizza, chips and drink and the roast beef sandwich for about $20.

The veggie sandwich is around $8 is also great. And the BLT is good as well.</text></sentence><sentence id="788"><text>came here on Monday, no line. its good, but not to go out of your way good.  price is reasonable, it is hard to find. but that was the fun of it trying to find it.  no name, no sign.  if your clubbing @ the Cosmo and your have the munchies this is your place.  they use fresh toppings, crust is thin and very tasty.</text></sentence><sentence id="789"><text>It's ok if it fits your budget. Plus when you get out your on freemont.  But if you are not a silly person or don't have enough drinks in you it will be hard to get into. Buy your tickets at tix4tonight on the strip it comes out to $104 for two. Don't get the pasta most didn't finish there's.  Chicken was o.k.   sodas are free and well drinks are $6.</text></sentence><sentence id="790"><text>for the PRICE the rooms are huge and very comfortable. the AC. was strong, for 110 degree heat, the beds were comfy and they have a hid abed. large bathrooms separate tub and shower. this place is a hotel first and casino second. All the rooms are in different buildings from the casino which makes it very family friendly.
        front desk was very friendly and helpful. Even though its not on the strip its a block and half away from the center of the strip. a short cab ride or a short walk and you can be at ceasers palace, bellagio, paris,and bally's for the shuttle to the Rio. wi-fi is free in the lobby and pool side. there is a fee to have it in your room. there is a resort fee if you book it through a third party like orbitz, travelocity, priceline,etc. you should check there price first and see if you can save some money. i was there from Thursday to Monday on labor day weekend. it was quite and peace full as appose to the chaos of the strip on a holiday weekend.</text></sentence><sentence id="791"><text>Again great deal for the price and location plus free breakfast.  $50 on Saturday.  King room, flat t.v.,kureg coffee, good water pressure, did not hear the people next door and hope they didn't hear us. (Unlike planet Hollywood where you hear everything)</text></sentence><sentence id="792"><text>cant go wrong here, in the mood for sandwich this is it. its baked and toasty, healthy and filling. its not as good as jersey mikes but almost there.  price is very Worth it.</text></sentence><sentence id="793"><text>OK OK this is the BEST buffet in Vegas period.  there is a lot of variety. the desserts are very good.  The lamb shoulder cooked to perfection.  but what does it is FREE all you can drink beer and wine.  I'm talkin about the regular buffet on Wednesday under $55 for two.  without a players club. we got to the line around 7 and were seated about 7:15. it wasn't to busy.
at the dessert bar you can order fresh coffee or a latte with Kahlua. If somebody hadn't told us we wouldn't have known. 
      everything was really good. The place is very clean.  Don't bother looking for the bathroom its not in the Buffet its outside to the right.</text></sentence><sentence id="794"><text>this is for the fireside lounge.
great place to finish the night off or start it.  the appetizers were large portions and the well drinks were also great.  it has a old las Vegas feel to it</text></sentence><sentence id="795"><text>mystery adventure is must do Sunday Thru Thursday. its great but its 3hrs+ long. i like the fact that it had something for everybody. you don't have to be a mystery junkie to enjoy the adventure. and for the price you really cant beat it. nothing in Vegas will keep you entertain for so long for so little, plus there's snacks to munch on while you try to look for clues. The one thing that is definitely fun is to determine what clues you need to solve the mystery and what clues you don't.   you'll get to meet people and work as a team to solve the mystery.  if your on a tight budget this is a must.</text></sentence><sentence id="796"><text>besides going up the Eiffel tower and the crepes its the only reason i even step inside the Paris casino.  I've been here several times already and it hasn't gotten old.  no cover, two drink minimum and  pricey to, if you haven't you must.  two guys on a piano going at it.  they play everything from oldies to today's music.</text></sentence><sentence id="797"><text>i was there from June 24 to 27th. the room big enough for four adults. we checked in early and we got a room on the 25th floor facing the strip. that was the best part. the view was unbelievable. the AC. was strong. the room was very modern and clean. the beds were very comfortable. the casino i didn't care to much about nothing special to see or write about. there is a free show outside the hotel. if you haven't seen it. its worth check out. the area is pretty good, there is tram to the mirage and next to that is ceasers palace and on the other side is a big mall. accross the street is the Venetian, Harras casino (and a shuttle to Rio that were the best buffet in vagas)and the carnival bar. pool parties are not the worst but not the best either. the DJ was pretty good ,the down side very little shade. 

there is a mandatory $22 a day resort fee that includes wi-fi in every room and newspaper in the lobby. they don't tell you about the fee until you check in.</text></sentence><sentence id="798"><text>great tip i found by accident. book your room through www.easyclicktravel.com and you wont pay a resort fee of $20 per night.

Really nice atmosphere, lounge-like seating areas and free wifi. What's not to like?  Well. While I did appreciate not being charged for soy milk, and I liked that they charged extra for to go/paper cups (I think it was 50 cents) the soy latte I had was totally awful. 

Bitter, sour and composed of mostly foam. Maybe this was an off day, but it was honestly atrocious. I wouldn't mind visiting Blondie's in the evening sometime, but I think I'll just skip the coffee from now on.</text></sentence><sentence id="802"><text>Relaxing atmosphere, educational chalk based corn diagrams, and air conditioning... what more could you ask for? Well, add to all of that, that the food is delicious. Maizal is a recent addition to the Liberty Village area. They have vegan and gluten-free options in addition to non-vegan/veg ones.

The menu is short and simple. At the moment, the vegan options are: grilled quesadillas sin queso (ask for no cheese/dairy) with either poblano peppers or mushrooms, the sopes with black beans, tlacoyos (bean filled tortillas), and opales (cactus.) All very yummy sounding options. Their tortillas are entirely corn based (and gluten-free) and made fresh every morning. (they also happen to be delicious.)

Other things on the menu I should mention: the horchata. Traditionally milk-less, it's rice based at Maizal, with a cinnamon spice, and perfectly ice cold. 

Outdoor patio space is out front on Jefferson, and small but decent. Interior space is ample, but I imagine it's going to be an area lunch time takeout place pleaser, a tasty, healthy meal for under ten dollars. If you sit in like we did, you can read about the history and cultivation of corn on the very aesthetically pleasing chalkboards (and no joke, it really is interesting.) And let me say it again: Air Conditioning.

We each ordered 2 grilled quesadillas sin-queso (no cheese.) We sat sipping on horchata's while we waited and enjoyed the corn diagrams. They arrived, with pico de gallo on shredded lettuce, and a side of refried beans.  One poblano pepper and one mushroom. One bite and I've decided these tortillas are made of tasty magic. That one bite was all tortilla, and it was so rich in maizey-flavour and texturally superior to nearly all other tortillas I've had up until now (so I eat a lot of tacos...)

The fillings for both were great, both hearty and satisfying with rich savory flavours. Add some of the pico and a touch of lettuce and it is perfection. The folks at Maizal are doing exciting things with food, and I'm looking forward to seeing more, and eating much more from them.

p.s. prices are reasonable.</text></sentence><sentence id="803"><text>This is another place I'd never have stumbled upon had it not been for the Indie Coffee Passport. I'm never in the George Brown area. We dropped in on a Saturday morning and it was mostly empty.  Walking by, it looks like an old antique furniture store with a random assortment of unmatched pieces.

No, but really, I like random, and I like the atmosphere, it's weird but well lit. I'll call it... cozy. I liked the big wooden table by the window I didn't have any luck connecting to their wifi with my ipod but I saw other people on laptops tapping away. Minimal plug ins, but they exist.

It was a beautiful looking cup of coffee, but it may have also been the worst almond latte I've ever drank. I think it's great that they offer almond milk, but I'm not convinced they knew how to use it that day. Overall... my problem was that the coffee was very bitter. Way too bitter. 

Although it didn't effect me, this place is cash only. No Debit Cards Allowed!</text></sentence><sentence id="804"><text>I went to Z-Teca for the first time a few weeks ago after being really excited to try it out. Unfortunately, as with most over hyped oversold places, once I did try it, I was really disappointed.

Service was friendly but the flavour was lacking. It felt like I had gone to Chipotle, but so much worse. The rice and vegetables were boring, and rice was in copious amounts. Beans are optional/extra? What is up with that? It's a burrito!

I doused my burrito in hot sauce to give it some flavour, and vowed to find some where else to go next time I was hungry in Fairview Mall.</text></sentence><sentence id="805"><text>So it's the first day Tori's Bakeshop is open, so maybe it's premature to review them... but I can't help it. Yelp must know about a new vegan &amp; gluten free friendly bakery.

It took me about 40 minutes on the Queen streetcar  to get here after work... but it was worth it. Since it was the end of the day, they had already run out of many of their sweet baked treats (even after apparently baking 3 day's worth of things) but I grabbed a vanilla cupcake with butter cream frosting, a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and a gluten free butter tart (and a non gluten free butter tart). They were all delicious. The cupcake was spongy and fluffy, the icing sweet, whipped, and not stiff at all. I was especially partial to the GF butter tart.

Friendly service, and great interior design. I loved the overhead lights - they're freaking lamps made from giant beaters, plus every table had fresh flowers on it. One word sums this place up -  adorable. (In two words - adorably delicious.) I love the random jars with stuff in it aesthetic. Lots of greens and neutral tones.

Also - wifi.Free functional wifi. There are outlets all over the place if you look for them (one main one that I know of is right at the front corner with the comfy seating. Yes.

Golly I wish this was closer to parkdale/trinity-bellwoods - though odds are, I'll be back really really soon.</text></sentence><sentence id="806"><text>I'm not quite sure what the fuss is about about Chipotle. My burrito was flavourless and unexciting. When I bit into it I couldn't help but think... wow, I waited 15 minutes in line for THIS? 

I think it didn't help that one of the members of counter staff left right as I got to her station, so I stood there an extra 5 or 6 minutes waiting for someone further down the chain to realize... oh nothing is happening.

The one of the things I did like was the tortilla chips with the hint of lime and the fresh pico.

Maybe I had a bad experience, maybe I've just had really amazing Mexican food, maybe I should try them again, or maybe I should just try a different location.</text></sentence><sentence id="807"><text>I'm late to the Hot Beans praising party, but not late in trying out their delicious tacos and donuts. Taking a bite out of one of their fresh lime coconut donuts makes me want to write poetry, but it looks like another reviewer has taken care of that.

So what can I say, I haven't eaten anything here I didn't like. The tacos are all delicious (though my favourite is the Yuba), and an order of nachos is filling and flavourful with spiced beans, cashew cream cheese, some kind of cheese sauce and veggies. I've been eyeing those burritos, but haven't gotten around to ordering one yet.

I'm happy to see a couple of different hot sauces on the side bench, along with a help yourself collection of water jugs. You might notice the lack of garbage can, well, everything is biodegradable. Which is awesome, but I can't help but be compelled to bring along a reusable container with me so I don't waste any more paper bags on donuts I inhale in 5 minutes anyway.

The limeade can be a bit too heavy on the agave sometimes, but otherwise I have no serious complaints. Service depends on the day and who's at the counter, but it's usually somewhere between decent and awesome.

The seating is limited to about 9-12 people depending on where you're sitting, but it hasn't felt crowded any of the (several several several) times I've gone in. There is a lot of foot traffic, people running in and out to grab a quick bite. 

The simplicity of their menu and pricing scheme is appreciated, just enough choice, without too much choice. What you see on the board, is what you will pay (tax is included), and combining donuts and tacos or beverages results in a nice round number which nutty folks like me will appreciate.

I haven't checked them out for breakfast on the weekends, but it's definitely on my to do list. Breakfast burritos... tempting, tempting.

Seriously, vegan or otherwise, at the very least pick up a donut, you wont regret it, really, go. Eat.</text></sentence><sentence id="808"><text>I've lived in Toronto for two whole years as of this month, and I have never once had  a bad time there. More often than not, we've gone there for brunch, and the service has been stellar. Not just hey they'll bring me my order the way I asked for it, but they'll do that AND be friendly, helpful, and fast. Service is great, they have on repeat occasions gone out of their way to be accommodating (without attitude).

A big one for me is they are vegan friendly (including the best most delicious vegan caesars in town) with most brunch items available veganized (and like every other brunch place they are omnivore and lacto-ovo-vegetarian friendly too,) you sit where you want, you can play board games if you want, you can drink bottomless coffee with your brunch if you want, you can ask for their fancy cocktail menu (yes, they have one), or just check out what's on offer to drink on the chalkboard.

I'll also say, that the food is okay. Tofu scramble is hit or miss, but usually it's decent enough that even on it's worse. I've had worse tofu scrambles at places catering to vegetarians, so there is that.

I've gone with friends, I've gone with family, I've gone in pairs, I've gone in big groups. Go for brunch. It's great. Go for drinks, it's fun. 

Other stuff: Cash only (but there is an ATM inside), they have baked goods and cheesecake from Through Being Cool (vegan) bakery, and conveniently close to Nazareth Ethiopian restaurant (eat delicious Ethiopian food then go drinking).</text></sentence><sentence id="809"><text>I finally went to Burritos Boyz the other day and I was really pleased with what I got. Flavourwise and servicewise it trumps Chipotle entirely.

I got a vegan burrito and didn't feel deprived of anything, it was a nice big meal. I really liked how they constructed it. It made a huge difference when biting in. There was an intermingling of flavours rather then the usual "oh here's rice, oh here's lettuce, oh here's salsa"  feeling I get from some other places. It was quite filling, though I probably could have eaten two for lunch. I think grilling the burrito is a nice touch, crispy on the outside warm and yummy on the inside. 

They have veggie ground round, and vegan guacamole, and hot sauce that's actually hot. I wish they also had some daiya, because that would have made this place all around perfect.

We got there right before the lunchtime rush, so not only did we get our orders quickly, I even snagged a seat in the corner.</text></sentence><sentence id="810"><text>There are a few vegan options here, and they are labelled clearly on the chalkboard near the cashier (though they don't always write everything they're serving on the board). 

Service was friendly and quick, I ordered the sweet potato and rapini pie, which wasn't as tasty as the dish my friends ordered (the cauliflower and soy protein pie). They have a vegan cheesecake that is phenomenal.

It's a cozy little space, and there were a few other folks there when we walked in on Saturday, but it didn't feel too crowded.

I'll have to try their coffee next time.</text></sentence><sentence id="811"><text>I went here last week on Friday, and it was great. I wondered why it had taken me so long to actually go in (well I know why, the outside doesn't look nearly as inviting as the inside does). Menu is colour coded and vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, or non-veg friendly. There is probably something for everyone here which makes it a good potential spot to take non-veg in-laws or something. 

Service was great, our server seemed to actually like it there, and was knowledgeable about the menu.

I had the phish and chips and would totally eat them again, pretty delicious. Crispy deepfried pieces of tender tofu, with a side of chips and spicy house made tartar sauce.

I think it's time to check them out for a Sunday brunch and see what it looks like on a busy day.</text></sentence><sentence id="812"><text>I prefer this location to the other ones in the city. We live really close to the Queen West one, but order delivery or dine-in at this one.

Dine in service is always friendly, and quick. Dishes are veganizable, there are lots of options, the food is always tasty and the portions are huge (we're eaters, but we still end up taking food home with us). The food could be spicier, but that seems pretty standard in this city and nothing a bit of hot sauce can't fix.

My delivery experiences have varied. When I order things through Order-It or Just Eat,  the resulting delivery takes forever, there are often issues with our order (like egg in the pad thai when we specifically said vegan/no egg), and the prices are more expensive than just ordering directly. 

So we started calling them to place delivery orders and things went much more smoothly. Orders seemed to come faster with no mistakes.</text></sentence><sentence id="813"><text>I went to check out Kupfert &amp; Kim today at First Canadian Place. It was reasonably busy, even at 3pm.

Service was friendly - though it seems like they have a lot of staff behind a very small counter (maybe it was shift change?) It's a very clean looking space, and I like the selection of vegan and gluten-free sweet treats, like stuff from Earth &amp; City, Bunners Bake Shop, and Rawlly Delicious.

I ordered the "First Canadian" , and while I've often felt really bored with bowls of vegetables/grains/etc, this one was a great mix of ingredients - tempeh, quinoa,  shredded red and green cabbage, sweet potato, and a flavourful dressing on the side.

They've got a decent selection of milks (soy, almond, coconut, and  rice) for prepared coffee drinks like cappuccino, lattes, etc.  and fresh juices.

Open from 8am to 5pm, they've got breakfast and lunch menus and seem like a great option for meatless, wheatless, fare in the Financial District.

They just opened two weeks ago, so they still seem to be working out all the kinks, and they don't have a (useful) website yet, but as far as the food is concerned - so far so good!</text></sentence><sentence id="814"><text>Love this place. Sure it was way out of town for me. Sure I can't figure out a way to get there with public transit from Toronto... BUT it's worth the trip, however you get there.

To be honest, before we went there I thought it was just going to be danishes, which was actually exciting in and of itself, BUT it had a variety of other Danish baked goods (like marzipan cookies, and kransekake ) as well as vegan chocolate bars, chocolate soft serve, cookies, brownies and biscotti. And little grocery type items like fake tuna and non-dairy cheese.

The woman that runs the bakery is so sweet and friendly, I felt like I could talk to her all day about food and not get tired of it. Another great part about this place is that it's inside of a costume shop. Can't go wrong with that.</text></sentence><sentence id="815"><text>I neglected to read the reviews on here regarding the Greyhound/Toronto Coach Lines line, and stood in line (at 5am I might add, 5am does not make me a happy camper) for 15 minutes while a woman argued with the counter guy about something ridiculous. I don't envy these people their jobs, I can't imagine the crap they have to deal with.

So I came to the counter, talking about Greyhound, he told me (and it's probably been the millionth+1 time he's said this.) to go to the greyhound counter down in the waiting room and talk to the guy in the vest. Well, shucks. Who knew. 

The waiting room was clean, my ticket situation was sorted out without any issue well before my bus arrived, so I really don't have any complaints.

I really hate going through airport security, and for certain trips (like NYC for example) the rates on the greyhound are really reasonable (especially with advanced purchase), I usually don't have to sit with anyone AND most importantly (is she joking?), I can get wifi the entire way down.</text></sentence><sentence id="816"><text>I'd like to say I loved this place, because for the most part I did.

The veggie selection was beautiful, the store was bright and clean, but ultimately, all of that was ruined by my experience at the check out.

I went through the self check out, you know, so I could avoid talking to cashiers and go through the process quickly? Instead the attendant would not leave me alone and it took twice as long.

He hovered and hassled me the entire time I was going through the check out, he yelled out the veggies at me that I was buying from his station, and it was really frustrating. It totally ruined the whole experience for me. 

If I do go back, I'm not going to bother doing self check-out (and I don't recommend anyone else does either), not much point if someone is going to micromanage the entire process.

I would have given this place a five, I wanted to give this place a two after I left, but it gets a begrudging three because it has such a nice selection and a clean bright location.</text></sentence><sentence id="817"><text>First of all, this is probably the best Vegetarian restaurant I've been to in the Toronto area, and probably in my top ten of vegetarian restaurants I've been to in North America.

I took a big burly omnivore with me, and he loved everything we ordered, so I take that as a great sign.

We started things off with an order of crispy oyster mushrooms and seared dumplings. I wish we had ordered two orders of the crispy oyster mushrooms because I can never have enough, they are so rich and flavourful and the sweet slightly spiced sauce is a perfect compliment for it.

We both ordered the Special of the Day, which was a tofu skin wrapped taro root mash on a bed of greens, with a side of noodles, and a flavour explosion of a mango salad. 

Our waitress totally sold it. Her description got my mouth watering from the very beginning. It adds so much to a meal when the server is friendly, and she was wonderful. Moreover, she clearly loved the place and the food, which is exactly the type of person I want advising me on what to order.

I was feeling pretty full after finishing my plate, but there is always room for dessert. My dining companion and I shared a piece of chocolate cake and a brownie sundae (but since they were out of brownie, they used lightly warmed chocolate cookies.)  What can I say, other than delicious! delicious! delicious! 

The chocolate cake was good, but not as good as the sundae. Though I'm glad our server made sure we took the left over chocolate cake home, because while it wasn't as awesome when it went head to head with the sundae, it was fantastic by itself at 3am.

In Short: 
- order the crispy mushrooms, you wont be disappointed. 
- And the Special; it's consistently amazing.</text></sentence><sentence id="818"><text>I've been travelling a lot lately and in the time I was away having fun and eating lots of great food, Bloomers opened and I was really looking forward to coming home and visiting this (still) new vegan cafe and bakery in Bloorcourt.

So finally,I got to visit them today. 

First impressions are: I love the wide open space, that there are multiple options for seating (booths, tables, high tables, etc). They've got free wifi (I didn't look for power outlets this time). Service was really nice and friendly. And I felt pretty comfortable just hanging out with my coffee for a bit

Today I saw a couple of different kinds of donuts, fluffy coconut donut holes, chocolate chip cookies, butter tarts, blueberry tarts, BAGELS, and a donut Bread pudding, and probably more, but I was especially drawn to the bagels, as I haven't seen bagels around any of the fine vegan bakeries we have in our city AND I happen to really like bagels (and usually end up making them myself). as an added bonus they had tofutti cream cheese available. 

They've got a variety of kombuchas, teas, blue sky soda, and assorted bottled fruit juices, in addition to fancy (and more regular) coffee options. 

I hear there is a menu extension coming in September with sandwiches and the like coming soon, so I'm pretty excited to check that out too when it appears.

I liked it here, I would (and will) be back again soon. 

Accessibility-wise: Today the door was wide open (otherwise it's not powered), but there is a bit of a quarter step to get in. And  in a wonderful departure from the usual Toronto bathroom in the basement style the restroom is on the main floor.

And regarding one of the other reviews... it seems a little (no, it seems a lot) ridiculous to complain about the lack of dairy products at a vegan cafe.</text></sentence><sentence id="819"><text>I come here about once every two weeks, mostly out of convenience, since it's near my workplace, has vegan options, and offers a decent alternative to subway/sushi/pizza options I have in the area.

Service is always friendly and helpful, reasonably quick, and they don't use a microwave to heat up your samosas - which some other Indian restaurants do in the area. Ew. 

I've had curry bowls from here in the past and like everyone has said, the curries are quite bland.  They are spiced but not really (especially if you've gotten used to more authentic little India flavours) and just generally have a "healthy" flavor to them. it's not terrible, but miss-able. 

I'd recommend the vegetable samosas instead (or get the spicy lentils as a veg dish for a closer to normal level of spice.) They do bake them - so they aren't deliciously deep fried, but still the filling is nice.

They've recently upped the price of the samosas, but 3 samosas and two chutneys will still only run you just under $5.</text></sentence><sentence id="820"><text>I like this place.  I need to go back on a Friday or Saturday night to see what it's really like, but I went a couple hours before closing on a Wednesday with Nicole H, and it was pretty comfortable with four tables occupied.

I like the interior, it seems like a place I would actually go to just drink coffee or do some work, with the added benefit of having games available if I wanted to play them.

They have a great selection of games in the back, and various events happen every week, including a Scrabble meetup group (Scrabble in the City) every Thursday night.

Beer and other alcohol selection appears ample, but since it was 3 pm on a Wednesday, I opted for tea. Prices for food and drinks are very reasonable, as of yet, there is no game playing fee.

As an extra bonus, service is friendly but also unintrusive.

No on-menu vegan food options or treats (yet), but they do make veg sandwiches with hummus, which is something.</text></sentence><sentence id="821"><text>I thought I was finished with Fresh, but a friend from out of town came to visit, and wanted to come here for brunch. So... okay, back to Fresh.

It still didn't win me over.  But this visit was better than before.

Our server was a bit weird, but ultimately helpful and friendly so that's all that matters. One of the other servers "helping" the table next to us was terrible and I'm glad we didn't have her. She seemed to be all attitude, and no help.

Brunch was great. I got the pancake platter, which comes with two pancakes of your choice, two vegan breakfast sausages and tofu scramble (for 12$). I could have done without the over-spiced boring tofu scramble, but the pancakes (banana-nut flavoured) were excellent, especially when slathered with margarine and dark rich maple syrup. Tofu sausage was fantastic.

I got an americano.  And while it wasn't a very big cup of coffee, or very caffeinated, it was very tasty.

I also ordered a side of soy yogurt, but really, I wouldn't recommend it. Unless you get some jam. It's not flavoured with anything so when you order soy yogurt that's really all it is, and it's not very good. 

Next time (since there will probably always be a next time with this place): BBQ Burger. How can I go wrong with a veggie burger, that also includes a couple of those delicious quinoa onion rings?</text></sentence><sentence id="822"><text>We went to Bello Bio earlier this month to check out their selection of products. All the food items there are vegan, and imported from Italy. The imported part sounded a little strange, since I've never thought of Italy as a very veg friendly place, but we learned from the owner, that Italy has a growing vegan/vegetarian population

Great selection of random products. They have grain based pseudo-meats, and a very interesting MozzaRisella sprouted rice based soft dairy free cheese, which made an excellent addition to a recent caprese salad. They have prepared foods, and frozen items available to take home (such as varieties of vegan stuffed ravioli.)

Those folks are friendly, and the products have a lot to offer flavourwise. And I liked that they have products that are vegan/plant-based, without depending entirely on soy.

I'm looking forward to going back and picking up more stuff soon!</text></sentence><sentence id="823"><text>We ordered delivery from this location and it was okay. But not amazing. 

I think their queen street location is better, or maybe we hit them on the wrong day. The fredo pizza is normally covered with thinly sliced potato and a nice level of rosemary and other spices, this time around, it was rather sparse. 

Considering they said an hour for delivery, and we were only 6 minutes away (if you walk), I would have expected they'd have enough time to actually cook the potatoes properly. I wish we had just picked it up, maybe it would have been better. 

They have three vegan pizza's on the menu and an extensive combination of other types as well. So I'd start the Pizziolo experience at a different location if you want something especially good. 

That said, my slightly undercooked potato pizza was still better flavour-wise than the Pizza Pizza in the neighbourhood.</text></sentence><sentence id="824"><text>Easy wasn't easy. I considered getting a smoothie and word on the street is their coffee is stellar. 

But it was busy, and after about 10-15 minutes, with no coffee, we left before ordering.</text></sentence><sentence id="825"><text>I've watch D-Beatstro improved their offerings and options over the last few months and it's been great to see them grow from sort of disorganized but charming to really having a solid menu, kitchen, and coffee set up. They have a nice variety of baked goods, occasionally have gluten-free options too for those of you that need/want them, and herbalist blended teas available. But my favourite thing now is their brunch, because it's good, really good.

Seating is comfortable and well spaced out, so if you're tired of sharing elbow room with other folks during weekend brunches - this might be a great spot to check out. The restaurant and cafe is also wheelchair and/or mobility device accessible with a ramp outside (they also have an accessible washroom.)

The folks here make a great soy latte, and why anyone would recommend going to a Starbucks or Tim Hortons over even a non-dairy latte, I don't understand, but Kevin S. you do you. They also have a variety of other fun drinks - like hot chocolate, white hot chocolate, matcha lattes, and other surprises in store for you.  They also "only" have soy, almond, coconut, and cashew. Oh no, too many options? Branch out a little.

Check em out for brunch or during the week.</text></sentence><sentence id="826"><text>You know those times when you visit a cafe or store and leave with the desire to tell everyone you meet how wonderful it is? That's how I feel about this place.

They have a great warm inviting atmosphere, and it's a cozy (i.e., kind of a small space). While there is room for about three people to sit in the window area, prepare to either stand and eat, or take a box home (or eat there, AND take a box of treats home like I did...)

The people working there are friendly and helpful, and when I walked in, all wide-eyed and overwhelmed with options, they gave me a run down of what they had and offered some recommendations. Bunner's was just all around fantastic from the start. And then... I ate one of the "gypsy" cookies, and I was completely sold. Oats, melty chocolate chips, dried cranberries and a few other things combined into a soft chewy cookie. I want to go back, right now, and get another one.

I should probably mention that in my experience gluten free tends to secretly mean gross, and I have been known to occasionally thank my body for not having celiac disease. So what I'm saying when I say this place is good, is that it's not just gluten-free good. It's actually good.

When I went in today there were cupcakes (three different kinds: vanilla, chocolate and red velvet), DONUTS, amazingly yummy cookies (gypsy cookie), freshly baked loaves of bread (which I'm kicking myself for not trying), muffins, and cookie sandwiches!

What I'm going to hope for is that every coffee shop in town starts using them as their source for vegan (and/or gluten free) treats. While they have decent enough coffee (and Silk Soy creamer is available), I sure wouldn't mind having one of their cookies or muffins with a nice soy latte. (Of course... Crema Coffee is just across the street...)</text></sentence><sentence id="827"><text>Balluchon is now i deal coffee. It's basically the same place, but better.

I love this place now, so my regular Monday Sorauren Farmers' Market visit is paired with a tasty cup of coffee from -i deal coffee- as well.

Service has been fantastic every time I've gone in. It feels like a space that's good to hang out in, they have vegan and/or gluten-free options, and have soy and almond milk at no extra charge (YEY!)

So lovely. I can't wait to keep going back.

As an added bonus, since they only recently took over that location they are part of the Indie Coffee Passport less-than-3 Edition, so you can give them a try, while taking advantage of a really great deal.

They're currently cash only, but it sounded like they were planning on getting a debit machine at some point.</text></sentence><sentence id="828"><text>You might have seen this vegan bakery win the Toronto Vegetarian Association's Vegan Bake Off (repeatedly), and you've might have seen it at the Vegetarian Food Festival, or at the Farmers Market or a bunch of other places around the city (and Ontario).

Now, you'll see it in a sweet location in the Annex.

Full disclosure: I've been excited about this bakery opening for months, and I don't care who knows it. I have wanted a source for a steady supply of vegan magic squares, and now I have one (p.s. get the magic squares)

I had the opportunity to visit the bakery during the sneak-peak opening in December, and bought magic squares (but not enough), a cookie, and a couple of candied apples and it felt like early Xmas.

Then I waited (im)patiently for their opening this month. And today I braved the snow and went in. I left with dark chocolate croissants, magic squares (obviously), and a pot pie. My partner came home with croissants, a couple of sausage rolls and a whoopie pie. Yes, we're getting ready to hibernate this weekend.

The croissants are ridiculously flaky, the magic squares are incredible as usual, I haven't eaten anything else yet, but I've sort of come to expect that anything from APiecalypse Now! will be really good.

In the fridge &amp; freezer so far they've got (all of these things are vegan): cashew ricotta, Caesar salad dressing, flavoured butters, lasagna, pot pies, shepherd pie, gluten free and gluten-full chili mac, potato salad, tzatziki, tartar sauce, Northwood Cold Brew Coffee (which I'm drinking right now - tasty), and more.

I like that there appears to be a sincere effort made to find ethical, ecologically sound, and human friendly products to make &amp; bake stuff, and that they have compostable packaging.

Service was friendly and fast &amp; they take cash, credit, and debit.

There is no seating inside, so prepare to take out.

P.S. try the magic squares.</text></sentence><sentence id="829"><text>This place is huge, but lacks seating. I spent a considerable amount of time visualizing how they could fit more tables in without getting to crowded, and I can see why they set it up the way they did. But a couple more tables wouldn't hurt. (but that's what everyone says).

I love the space. Floor to ceiling windows facing Queen St and the rest is brick. High ceilings, ample bookshelves and the random old stove in the center... it just works.

I ordered a soy latte, and it was delicious, not too bitter, not too boring. Foam was nice and thick (but not too much) Just right. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have any "to stay" cups. But on the plus side, they've got free wifi and they don't charge extra for soy milk.

One thing I find really cool about Ground Level is that it operates as part of Ground Level Youth Ventures where youth learn life skills and job training (beyond just making coffee). Definitely something I'm into supporting.

I went here solely because it was part of the Indie Coffee Passport, but I'll go there again if I'm in the neighbourhood. My latte was better than the cups I've gotten from other shops in the area.</text></sentence><sentence id="830"><text>Feel Good Guru is in the progress of slowly opening.  It's a take-out place right across the street from Trinity-Bellwoods Park, and conveniently located in my neighbourhood. I walked in not caring what I ordered, I wanted to try... anything. 

I ordered the soup, which was a hearty miso based vegetable lentil, with lots of greens and packed with flavour. Perfect for today's rainy glumness.

The space is really clean and relaxing, there is seating for about 4 people, but like I said, it's styled as a take-out place (so you know, you could hypothetically take stuff out, and eat in the park.) There are fresh herbs in a wall-mounted garden (that look absolutely lovely). They also have a useful website that actually gives you the information 

I've come to expect raw cakes to be delicious, and Feel Good Guru's cake was no exception. In fact... it was even better than I expected it to be (and the raw bar is raised pretty high already.)  She gave me a sample for free, and I want more of that chocolate heaven in my mouth. Luckily they are right down the street, so I could wander over any time I want. Lucky me.</text></sentence><sentence id="831"><text>Meh. I'd feel okay just leaving the review at that. This place embodies meh, I've had better. 

I walk by every day on the way to work, so I thought... maybe this will be my alternative to Starbucks or (on days when I feel like being treated rudely) Tim Hortons. Nope.  The coffee tasted burnt, in a bad way. And soy milk is 0.70 cents extra (I hate that.)

I was oversold on the 20$ gift card. I like going out for coffee because it's relaxing - I didn't expect to have to say "no not interested" to some pseudo promotion (gift card - meh) repeatedly.

With the exception of the sales pitch,  service in general was quite friendly though. But not friendly enough that I would go back again.</text></sentence><sentence id="832"><text>This location was my first foray into the Pizzaiolo chain since moving to Toronto.

We went to this location at 3am on a Saturday night and asked for half a fredo (with potatoes, rosemary and oregano)  and half a vittoria (tomatos, zucchini, red peppers). They didn't even blink, no problem, done. When we got it, it was packed with toppings, hot and delicious. Everything seemed cooked to perfection. 

Afterwards service was a bit off, I tried to buy a drink, and stood at the counter, drink in hand while the server talked on the phone... for about five minutes. Then I put the drink back in the fridge and sat down to finish my pizza. 

On the plus side, the variety of pizza they offer is nice, they have vegan and vegetarian pizza available by the slice (amongst others), and they are open super late.</text></sentence><sentence id="833"><text>It's a Starbucks, with the same problems and benefits that every Starbucks has. The coffee is the same as every other starbucks, and they never seem to use separate containers for soy and dairy frappuccinos but they are quick, there is lots of seating, and a good collection of power outlets at this location (you just have to find them)

Overall, it's always clean, some of the staff are reasonably friendly.</text></sentence><sentence id="834"><text>No more trudging downtown to get a oily slice of potato rosemary (The Fredo) pizza for me, finally, a new Pizzaiolo up north and in my neighbourhood.

This location is clean, and at 4pm, completely empty except for the reasonably friendly dudes working there. They had a special deal going on for a free beverage with purchase for their grand opening (which is now over) but honored my request anyway. Free soda is always a plus. 

Pizza was decent. One half of the GIANT slice was perfect, the other half was more than half of my daily requirement of olive oil. Crispy tasty crust, maybe verging on too crispy, but it was still within tolerance levels. Also, I'm happy that they actually had a vegan pizza available, which is more than I can say for half of the downtown locations I've been to after 7pm. 

I'd come here again and I hope business picks up because that area has been lacking in quick tasty (vegan or otherwise) food options.</text></sentence><sentence id="835"><text>I've been going to Totum for almost a year now I think, and it's been great for seriously getting into weight lifting without having to navigate through clusters of bros and other gym jerks. Everyone is generally nice, respectful of space, and you know, no one is ever doing bicep curls in the squat rack.

I still haven't convinced myself to go on a repeat visit to any of the 6am classes, but they exist for those pre-work workout fiends. I'm just too much of a night owl. I'm also lazy.

Classes to chose from include yoga classes, Pilates, boxing, kettle bell workouts, spinning, crossfit, and a whole bunch of others. Lots of elliptical machines, 5-6 treadmills, and bikes. They also have a decent variety of weight machines, free weights, and other equipment to play with.

There is one personal trainer that without fail will change the music station from some amazing techno/dub/remix (you know, perfect workout music) to some weird classic rock/easy listening/crud, so word of advice - bring some headphones if you're going in the middle of the day. The weekend hours are not as convenient (they close at 6ish), but I do like that they're open later than most gyms on Fridays.

One other thing I like is that they have other sport related services available on site. In addition to personal trainers, there are chiropractors, RMTs, a holistic nutritionist, and an ND. It's nice to have the option of just going in, working out, seeing an RMT, or someone else, and going home.

It's clean, friendly, and welcoming. There is a free week trial, and I'd totally recommend you try it out. But only if you're awesome.

Worst/best thing - it's right next to Soma Chocolate.</text></sentence><sentence id="836"><text>I went to Nazareth yesterday and we lucked out because it was nearly empty inside (however it filled up within 30 minutes of our arrival and then there was a bit of a line.)

The service was fast and friendly, but there was a bit of a wait to get our actual plate, but it wasn't uncomfortably long. Our server checked on us regularly and was very pleasant.

We ordered one order of the vegetarian combination plate, and between the two of us, we still didn't finish all of it.

Over all it was a great experience, we got there at just the right time and the bill was ridiculously cheap.</text></sentence><sentence id="837"><text>Upon walking in I was delighted to see that they brew a very familiar coffee, Stumptown Coffee (the coffee found in nearly every coffee shop everywhere in Portland, Oregon... aka Stumptown.) The nostalgia was short lived, I think I prefer the Intelligencia coffee I've had nearly everywhere else in the city.

My barista was friendly, and helped me out right away, so that part was nice. 

They charge extra for soy milk, and in doing so, became the most expensive latte I've had in Toronto (however, I should also mention, the portion is comparatively bigger than other places so I'm not exactly complaining about that part.)

Lit has WiFi! Lots of seating, and a nice interior.</text></sentence><sentence id="838"><text>I like this place, I guess that's why I keep coming back. The seats are comfortable, I like that I can lean back, and the temperature has always been decent (unlike some places). The location can't be beat (easy access from Dundas Subway).

I know some people aren't into the "butter flavoured topping" that AMC has going on, but I love that it's available. Not that it's in anyway good for you (mmm soybean oil...), just that all signs point to its veganness, which works for me.

As with every movie theater, they will gouge you at the concession, and make you wish you had the foresight to sneak in your own snacks.</text></sentence><sentence id="839"><text>I didn't mean to go to Freshii for lunch the other day, but events conspired in such a way that I was in the neighbourhood (hoping to buy a Indie Coffee Pass from Crema Coffee - but they were sold out) and the line was short (because their debit was down) and my stomach decided it was time to eat.

After looking at the menu board, I filled out the custom order form (and there were LOTS of options to choose from.) s  and handed it to the nice server informing everyone that the debit machine wasn't working. (right at noon time! what terrible timing!)

I got the spinach wrap, grilled and filled with veggies, with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Can't go wrong with that combo. It was warm and fast. Even though there wasn't much reason to (nothing to melt, nothing needed to be cooked) I'm glad I got it grilled. It seemed to help keep the wrap together as I was running down Bloor.

If you don't feel like making up a meal for yourself they also have a huge selection of "Chef Creations" (at least one of which is vegan)  that you can modify further if you feel like it (for an extra charge).

The other benefit to this location is that Crema Coffee is right inside, so you can get a wrap, salad, bowl, or whatever AND get a delicious cup of coffee too. And by the way, Crema has one of the best soy latte's I've had in the city... though maybe I should save that for a Crema review...

Just a note, I can never get the freshii wifi to work with my iPod Touch, but I can connect to it with my netbook. Maybe it's me, but I'm just going to blame them on this one.</text></sentence><sentence id="840"><text>I love Shauna's!  The prices are great, Shauna is really nice and my dog has a good time playing there. Shauna is very knowledgeable and you can tell that she loves animals. If I had even the slightest notion that my dog wasn't being cared for, I wouldn't go there. It's too bad someone had a negative experience, but I've been here many times and have always seen the dogs in their care happy. I have sent many friends to Shauna's and am glad that she's so close by. I highly recommend!!!!</text></sentence><sentence id="841"><text>I've been going here every other week for a mani pedi for several months now.  I like the staff. They are professional and friendly. I feel comfortable there.  I like the massage chairs and the fish tank, both help me relax.  I'm a stickler for cleanliness and their tools are always sterile (autoclaved) and they use liners in their foot baths.  The service is very consistant from tech to tech, so I don't feel the need to be choosy about who does my nails.  They give a lengthier massage than most places, but I find the massages lack-luster.  That's really my only suggestion for improvement. Better massage technique.  My gel polish lasts a full two weeks and so does my pedicure (not gel).  I really like this place and will continue to treat myself to a trip to Dream Nails every other week!</text></sentence><sentence id="842"><text>We have visited many many times over the years.  I love the salsa.  The food is excellent and fresh.  I wish they would give out a larger bowl for the salsa since the small cups available are not easy to dip a chip in, however this is a small complaint.  The only other negative is the "ambience," which is lacking. Not the most comfortable chairs.  Everything I've tried has been excellent.  The staff is friendly.  Love it!  We will continue to be regulars.</text></sentence><sentence id="843"><text>I love Heidi's!!!  I go here often and always receive friendly service and delicious food.  My husband and kids love it too.  As many before me have said, the bread is fantastic. We buy loaves when we are there so we can enjoy it at home. I've tried the eggplant parm sandwich, egg salad, veggie, grilled veggie and a few others and all have been excellent!  I'm a vegetarian, so it's nice to have lots of choices here.  My husband has had roast beef, Italian, pastrami and other subs and has always been happy.  I send friends and family here. Everyone has been happy.  I highly recommend Heidi's!</text></sentence><sentence id="844"><text>I came in to get some boba tea and there was a employee eating behind counter that wasn't professional.

Immediately upon arriving I was happily greeted by 3 women at a side desk. They immediately informed me that the ambulance had just left and Dr Adams was a few minutes behind. This was fine with me. There were 4 patients waiting and the office was comfortable and clean. They made sure all waiting patients knew of the situation and one by one called them back. About 45 minutes later, happily to my suprise, I was already called back!  Yolanda took my weight and BP  - she was professional and kind. She did my initial intake and we had a nice laugh as well. Dr Adams was in the room in about 5 minutes! Now where do I start. Dr Adams is very professional and thorough. She was interested in my home life and even what I was reading in the office! We discussed many options of treatment for my 3 reasons of being in the office. She gave me immediate referrals and advice that I felt was not only professional but thoughtful in her answers. She even called for my bloodwork and labs right there in the office instead of sending me on a goose chase to a random lab. She related to me and understood my past with what I felt very comfortable sharing with her. I have searched for a doctor in NV for 10 yrs. I am so pleased that I actually look forward to going back to see Dr K. Adams. You are truly one of a kind Dr. Adams! God bless you!</text></sentence><sentence id="846"><text>Today my best friend and I went to serenity nails at 1pm. They sat us down immediately. The entire place stunk of someone's lunch. They began to fill the pedicure tubs and when we asked for it to be warmer one woman began scooping the water out (while on her cell phone and chewing with her mouth open) we sat with the running water and nobody to turn it off for 8 minutes until it began to overflow. In which we recorded this embarresment of a "salon" proceeded to put on our shoes and leave. The blue pedicure water covered half of the back salon and at one point another man doing a manicure stood up, observed the mess all over the flow and sat back down to the manicure lol! If I could stand on the corner directing people just a block down to Dream nails I would pay them not to step foot in this facility. What a joke!</text></sentence><sentence id="847"><text>Went for a special occasion and let them know in advance, asked for a nice table, we were put in a corner in a cold area was so cold my shoulders hurt and feet were like ice, when I asked to move they were reluctant even though the place was far from full, they did move us however next to a drafty door. The waiter comes out overly friendly, with phoney smile as others on the staff. The truffel soup was like a bowl of salt water.  The Pasta dish was cheap dumplings with frozen peas and 2 mexican shrimps chopped up so small and yes a lot of salt. The Salmon  was bland but the mashed cauliflower under it was salty and not cooked all the way, the broclii was burned, we left half of our meals on our plates and no one asked why? The service was horrible we constantly had to ask the bus person to find us the waiter. Way Way overpriced and an added 18% service charge for poor service. They never said, thanks good bye or come again. I read so much good about The Farms that I really wanted to go, but it is a Never Again, does not deserve a 2nd chance, $180.00 for 2 and did not eat and 2 beverages. Also my stomach was very uncomforatable from so much salt,  I felt very nausiated.</text></sentence><sentence id="848"><text>This little coffee shop offers a great spot to meet up, have an office gathering or just sit and people watch.

It was the last restaurant my husband and I visited during our get-away. We were shocked at the quality of food for the price. Cool atmosphere and lots of quality beers to choose from.

They had catered my husbands work and before he even proposed he said that we should have Up N Smoke cater our wedding when that time came. SO when we were planning I made sure to hire them. I personally never tried it but I trusted my husbands tastes buds and I couldn't have been happier that we went with them. Rich was so fast to respond and to answer my questions. He was even willing to work with us around the timing of our ceremony and setting up the buffet, so we wouldn't be hearing clinging and clattering while we were saying our vows. Once everyone was served, Rich and his crew put all the left overs in tin pans and had everything cleaned up in a blink of an eye! All night I was hearing about how good the food was from all our guest, and I myself have been loving having the left overs to eat and enjoy for the last few days! I almost want to find another event soon to have to order different food from them so I can try out their whole menu!!! If you want great BBQ food, and have an amazing costumer service experience go with Rich and Up N Smoke!!</text></sentence><sentence id="855"><text>My wedding was just at Villa Tuscana this past weekend. I honestly couldn't say a bad thing about these wonderful people!! I was in a few times from when we booked them in July, and they were always so willing to sit down and talk to me about my worries and my questions. In the end the hall was decorated even better then I thought. They were so willing to help me and I had a lot of last minute minor changes and they were there helping me set up the room the way I wanted it to be!!!  I also love that the base price includes SO much. Most places that I was going to to have chair decorations it was going to be an extra charge. To do this centerpiece was going to be an extra charge. Villa Tuscana does have a deluxe package but the base package includes so much that if you can't afford the deluxe items you still can have a wide selection of choices! Also there are some great things that come with the package, the DJ is included, the cake is included, and the photographer is included.  I highly recommend taking a look at Villa Tuscana for any kind of big event that you need plan!</text></sentence><sentence id="856"><text>Great customer service! They go above and beyond with making you feel comfortable and giving you the hairstyle you ask for! Andrew did an awesome job on my husband and Mariana did an amazing job with my hair!

Definitely will be back!</text></sentence><sentence id="857"><text>I came here with expectations after reading some reviews here. I have to say the service was not as bad as I thought it would be. It is your average Asian resto service. Distant and quick. I got the pho with just the noodles and it was better than Pho Kim Long's! They do not give you a lot of mint and sprouts like Pho Kim Long but I am sure if you ask for more they will give you more. The large was not that big but it was enough for me. They have bigger bowls at Pho Kim Long. Over all I say its not bad. I will come back here just because the Pho was great. Service could be better but hey no one said you have to be happy at work. As long as they do their job right, you do not have to be my BFF.</text></sentence><sentence id="858"><text>Service is bad, very slow. Food is meh. I do not recommend this place. I don't know how they stay open. Will not go back there unless there is no other option.</text></sentence><sentence id="859"><text>Ok, the pho was not bad tasting at all. It was actually ok however 2 hours after I ate it I experienced dizziness and got nauseated and ill! I threw up all the food that I ate from that place.

I do not wish it on anyone. Be warned.</text></sentence><sentence id="860"><text>Service is slow! Don't bother coming here if you want to be fed. A couple of people were waiting and no one came to even get our drink order. It's not a big place so I don't know what the problem was.

It was my first time at this salon and she was great! She was very good at was she does. We talked about what kind of cut I wanted and she listened and made some suggestions. I like that she was not overly chatty and she just did what she had to do which was to cut my hair. Leah did not act like she was my bff and I like that. I did not come there to chat but to get a good haircut. 
Leah is skilled and knows how to cut coarse asian hair. She cut my hair just like the way I wanted it and she was so nice. The cut was for $30 which was reasonable and there was no push to sell you any shampoo or hair products which I really like. I dont like to be put on the spot after a haircut to buy hair products that I do not need.
I highly recommend Leah to anyone. I am so glad to have found a great hairdresser that can cut my hair the way I want it!</text></sentence><sentence id="862"><text>Great place! Great customer service. I checked into Yelp and got 20% off my tab. The sushi was ok, I have had better. Lots of dessert options. The food was ok. They had oysters for lunch!

We did the $20 for 1 hour and ride all the rides you want. They had about 5 to 6 rides for kids and 2 rides for adults. Its ok. It is one of those places that you go once and then thats it. he mini carts were fun but I would not do it again. I dont know why. Maybe its the smell of the fumes coming from the carts or maybe it just did not do it for me. Even our 8 yo was just ok with it. I guess it depends on how much you like mini cart rides.</text></sentence><sentence id="864"><text>Our son loves it here! For $7 the whole family can get a great workout. The bouncers can benefit on getting some repairs but not too bad, they work. Fun, fun place! Closed for parties on the weekend and open Tue-Fri 930-1230 and 2-5pm. Call first to check the hours. Worth the trip if you want to have fun and get a work out. Dont forget socks for everyone. They are mandatory!</text></sentence><sentence id="865"><text>Ivy is great!  The place is clean and the techs are courteous.  The only draw back is the smell of nail salon, I dont know if it is the acetone but it is strong.

Basically I paid $66/night to stay in this hotel. I would not have minded that if the hotel was just honest about it. I think that it was very sneaky for them to practice such a thing.

The resort is huge. It's like an apartment complex and since we arrived late at night the grounds were so dark it was tough to find your duplex like room. It was nice that we were connected only to another room. The grounds were clean and quiet. The bed was soft and comfy. The AC was cold and loud. It had room for 2 people and a kid. The furniture was old and the the tv in the living room and bedroom was ancient. I did not even try and use it. The in room safe actually uses a key..lol (not code).

The room has old stained carpet and the ceilings have beams. The bathroom was old and small. On our first night we actually had no hot water in our room. We showered in lukewarm water. I called the front desk to report it and the lady acted like I was bothering her. The next day at 830 am, thank God we were already awake, with our DND sign on the door we get the maintenance people at our door minimizing our no hot water complain. I insisted they check and surprise, surprise it was broken! I demanded to be moved to another room.

The man on the phone who moved us was probably the only normal person there. He was appropriate  and helpful.  The rest of the staff in this facility have no customer service skills. They just don't care.

They also put a $100 hold on your CC when you check in. I am waiting for them to remove that on my CC or I will definitely dispute it.

I would not recommend anyone to stay here. Except for the soft bed and extra pillows there is nothing here to write home about. There are a lot of other places in Scottsdale that will appreciate your business and you can get more for your money.

Although I do not eat any kind of seafood I have to say they have the best selection of crab. They had the Alaskan King crab and the snow crab in buckets! This place is like crab heaven if you like crab. They have melted butter that you can scoop up to your hearts content and they have champagne in a glass now not in those cheapy plastic containers they do in other casinos. I like the salad selection and of course the choices in bread. I do not eat bread although I love bread because of the high carb content but enough about that. The bread had to be tried! It was delicious, and they had real butter on the side. Soft butter, not the frozen kind. The butter was at room temperature so it was easy to spread it on your bread. Yum! 

Alright downside to this place is you have to be ready to wait. It felt like a line at Disneyland to get into one of those rides! The line was long! We waited 75 minutes to be seated and we stayed for 2 hours inside. Prepare to wait folks. It is worth the wait but do not come here starving hungry because you will wait and you will end up grouchy and impatient by the time you get to the cashier. Eat enough for about an hour wait and then be ready to feast! Happy eating1</text></sentence><sentence id="873"><text>Great service . Jace is wonderful.

I hope the owners realize their place is a dump! The food is old and tasteless. Its messy and the restaurant is unkept. I cannot imagine what the kitchen looks like. They do have an "A" rating but that food is just plain bad! We used to go here years ago when it had the same reputation and quality as Asia Buffet. The place now is like the haven of people who just need something to fill their stomachs for cheap. No quality, no taste kind of food and cheap. It is sad to see what happened to the quality of this restaurant. I will never go back there unless it is a no choice kind of situation. Do yourself a favor and drive down to Asia Buffet. A few dollars more and it will be worth your time and money. There are also some very seedy characters in the resto. Bad, cheap food attracts the bad customers? lol</text></sentence><sentence id="880"><text>Great place for kids to learn how to swim. The pool is warmer than the YMCA pool which kids love. Kids can swim year long and not be cold. When they get out of the pool the whole room is warmer and the showers are nearby. The facility is clean and the workers are friendly.  Kids learn at their own pace so don't expect your kids to be like Michael Phelps after they finish their summer classes. 

I recommend year round classes if you want your child to be good at swimming. 2 months of class is not enough to make them great swimmers. I highly recommend this place for learning how to swim.</text></sentence><sentence id="881"><text>Careful about signing up with this facility. This place is concerned about profit only (selling tshirts,pants, etc.). High pressure shady sales tactics.  They make it very hard to cancel your membership.

Very disappointing.</text></sentence><sentence id="882"><text>I like this place. It is your usual busy Chinese restaurant. No smiling, busy, no nonsense waiters.

They gave me robe and your own locker to put your things in. I was so far impressed. I did not have to wait for very long at all and my therapist got me into the nice massage room right away. My therapist was ok. She was not the friendliest although I like that she was not chatty at all. Her pressure was not that firm. I guess I could have told her to give me more pressure. No water at the end of your massage like other places. She disappeared after the massage never to be seen again...lol.
The check out was interesting. There was a pimple faced teen ago boy at the desk that was not sure exactly what to say. I figured a business like this will have a receptionist all the time and not an awkward boy at the check out not knowing what to say to customers. I cannot even express anymore how weird the check out process was and the tip giving. There was no envelope to put your tip and my therapist was no where to be found! I gave her a good tip and handed it to the boy. I hope she gets it.
Overall the customer service at this place is terrible. The massage was ok. I would NOT recommend this place unless you are just desperate for a massage. This place feels like these people are just going through the motions. Their hearts are not in the right place and I did not feel any pride in their work.  It is clean though, other than that..stay away.</text></sentence><sentence id="886"><text>The place is a sit down kind of restaurant . The menu is not very helpful and the food selection is limited. I am used to Filipino food places like Fiesta Filipina where you can come in and pick any food you want quickly because it's ready. I was disappointed to see that it was a sit down place. There is also a distinct smell to the place. I don't want to say it smells bad but it was noticeably present.</text></sentence><sentence id="887"><text>Sunday early morning at 130am my AC in my house broke.

We were picked up from the Aria tour bus pickup area, which is underground. Once we picked up a few more people at Excalibur, we were whisked away and headed out of town. A surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures. After this, we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver. Alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test (whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back). All wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality, although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected (no wonder most people gets the red wrong). The first winery we visited was Pahrump Winery. One of the owners, Gretchen, was so very informative and enthusiastic. She was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked. Following a tour and wine tasting, we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch. This lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour. My wife and I, being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines (which I highly recommend). Some of the wines that weren't on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously. We picked out several of our tastings and Gretchen's friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home. We also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to Alan to load onto the bus for us. We were then on the road again and headed to the next winery, I would say that after the first winery, the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience, but I was to be mistaken. The second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and I both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket. As well, the tasting room was a bit "homey". I hope they can make it work eventually, but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop. On our way back, Alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink, but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time. I'm not entirely sure that Alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on. I would also encourage Alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing them...if someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery, the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine. Listen enthusiastically and respond positively. Aside from these notes, the tour is great for the value. Those who love amazing wine, great food and education on how a winery runs will not be disappointed!</text></sentence><sentence id="891"><text>Best margaritas around!

Brian is so very knowledgable about their wines and is not afraid to give you his personal opinion instead of the usual tasting notes you get from others elsewhere. I would highly recommend this place if for no other reason than the amazing selection they have from all over the world. Mentioning a varietal, appellation, region, food pairing or any other descriptor will get you a list of suggestions. 

I would highly recommend working through their selections...the wine cellar has some interesting finds as well.</text></sentence><sentence id="893"><text>My wife and I had an early dinner here on a Monday. The staff was friendly and helpful, but it was obvious that the other waiter was much more interested in customer service than our waitress. Our waitress read off some specials, but we overheard the other waiter reading off a much more extensive list and go out of his way to make his diners much more comfortable.

The food was OK, but overpriced for what we received. I would not recommend getting anything with snap peas as the chef does not know to trim the stem ends off of the peas. The risotto also seems to be a favorite as it is a side with many entrees; however, it is a bit dense (Gordon Ramsey would not approve). It is very obvious that they are doing their best to make this establishment work, but I think they still need to update themselves a bit in order to draw a younger crowd. At present, it is a "blue hair" establishment. This may be the image they are looking to portray and clientele they are looking to attract, but the image discourages those under 40 from dining here.

I would also look to update the wine list. At present they have a wide range, but these are the very traditional and well-known mega-winery names. I would like to see some more unique items on the list.</text></sentence><sentence id="894"><text>This stop is a gem on the strip. Situated on the second floor of the Cromwell hotel across Las Vegas Blvd from Caesar's Palace, The view is excellent. Depending on the time of day and your seating location you may even take in a view of the Bellagio fountain show. The service was a bit slow and we spent roughly 15 minutes there before anyone came to our table, but our server seemed to have a number of tables so we can certainly understand the delay. We were there for lunch and as this was a special occasion, we brought our own bottle of wine. The corking fee was a bit high (but not for Vegas prices) at $35, but it was still a steal considering that almost every wine on the list was an ultra premium wine. Once we ordered, our food came out exceptionally fast. We highly recommend the baked pasta of the day, the Buratta cheese (buffalo mozzarella), Baby Sweet Peppers and Marinated Olives. Our total dining experience lasted over 1 1/2 hrs. We were so fulfilled by the time we left. In the end, when our check came, we found that the corking fee was not on it. This may have been due to the fact that we bought so many dishes during lunch or maybe our overwhelmed server simply forgot, but we weren't complaining :) 

I would highly recommend Giada's for lunch!  All their food is fresh and homemade, which is somewhat rare these days, even on the strip.</text></sentence><sentence id="895"><text>One of the best places in Tempe to get a late-night snack that isn't horrible for you.  I'm guilty of not always (or even usually) going with the most healthy options, but the sheiftalia platter has got to be better for me than a burger and fries, right?  Their tzaziki is bomb, the sheiftalia is delicious and tender and juicy and coated in just the right amount of lemon-y-ness, and their pitas are thick and soft, the way they should be.  They're open 'til 3:30 AM, and they deliver.  If you love good food and like to eat at weird hours of the night, do it here.  You won't regret it.</text></sentence><sentence id="896"><text>This is the some of the yummiest Chinese food I've had since moving to AZ, and absolutely the yummiest Chinese delivery I have had since moving here.  I've only found three or four places total that have delivered, and all of them have been mediocre or worse, except for Asia Lee.  Everything I've gotten from them is delicious; last time I ordered Szechuan Beef, Pork Egg Foo Yung, and the free Chicken Fried Rice that comes with any order of $15 or more.  I wasn't a huge fan of the pork that came with the Egg Foo Yung, but the egg patties themselves are savory and delightful.  The Szechuan Beef is my absolute favorite, and it made a great lunch when I reheated it the next day, as welll.  I've never been inside the restaurant, so I can't vouch either way for the last review, but honestly, why would I go to the restaurant when I can have all the yumminess delivered right to my door?</text></sentence><sentence id="897"><text>Okay, so I might be a total weirdo, but I wake up craving Pei Wei's fried rice some days.  There is very little I enjoy more than waking up hungry at 10 AM on one of my days off, logging on to Pei Wei's website, and ordering fried rice just the way I like it without having to explain it to anyone and risk them writing it down wrong.  I'm antisocial, so what?  Then, I know that when they open at 11 AM they will have my very special order of fried rice hot and ready waiting for me.  The portions are huge, so a $6-$7 order of fried rice can last me up to four meals, which is an awesome [if not exactly healthy] deal.  

I don't really like much of their other food that I've tried.  There's some sort of curry dish that was nice, but I'm sticking to my fried rice with extra egg...  yum.</text></sentence><sentence id="898"><text>Their specials menu is extremely misleading -- I went there on a Wednesday, and according to the menu you get "50 cent drafts with any entree."  So I ordered an entree and asked what they had on draft.  Apparently that wasn't specific enough, because my beers were $5 a pop.  The waitress played dumb, and when I spoke to a manager he treated me like an idiot for not asking for the "draft specials" rather than the drafts.  That language is nowhere on the menu.  He told me if I didn't want to pay that much, "we were going to have a problem."  He didn't even offer any sort of discount or anything, claiming that "he didn't write the menu."  I paid and left, and I'll never go back, simply because they're purposefully misleading and expect their drunk customers not to ask questions at the end of the night. 

Also, the stalls in the women's restroom have no locks.  Charging five bucks for a plastic cup of beer, they should be able to afford to get that fixed.</text></sentence><sentence id="899"><text>This is my go-to bar.  I'm not into the scene at places where there's a lot of loud, obnoxious frat boys.  Four Peaks isn't especially quiet, mind you.  They play pretty good music for the most part, and almost every time I've started to groan because of the song that just came on, someone who works there changes it.  The service is a little slow, usually, but I honestly don't care.  The food is amazing, and the beer...  oh, the beer.  I love the Sunbru for warmer days, and the Oatmeal Stout when its chillier out.  I always end up drinking a little more than I planned because they're so delicious, and that leads to me splurging on appetizers.  My favorite is the spinach artichoke dip.  

All of their beers are worth trying, since they brew them there you're not going to get them anywhere outside of AZ, as far as I'm aware.  If you don't know where to start, for $9 you can order the sampler, and get a tiny glass of each kind of beer they brew, then decide for yourself.  

Short version: good food, good beer, one-of-a-kind establishment, go, now.</text></sentence><sentence id="900"><text>Me and a friend ordered delivery through GrubHub, which was fine.  The bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.  (I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple. 

My friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.

I am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar. It was overall bland, I tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it; they turned out to be peanuts, which I don't love to begin with, but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what you're eating, you know that it's not very flavorful. The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING. I'm really sad there's no decent non-pizza places that deliver to my new apartment. 

For a $50 delivery order, I was extremely disappointed. Worst $50 I've ever spent on a meal.</text></sentence><sentence id="901"><text>I love Dutch Bros!  I'm a dedicated punch-card holder, addicted to iced Kickers, which are their Irish-cream flavored specialty.  They're really rich though, just so you know what you're getting into before you take my advice.  They make it with cream, but you can also get it with less fatty milks (or soy milk).  If you want the full experience, get the cream though.  

I also love that their prices are all in increments of $0.25, including tax.  It's just a nice touch.  :)</text></sentence><sentence id="902"><text>Oh, what a wonderful experience.  

My boyfriend and I were going a little nuts on Groupon yesterday (I think we purchased 3 different deals) when we discovered a Groupon Now! for Thai Buffet.  My boyfriend is a huge buffet fan, and we both love Thai food.  He got really, really excited and I couldn't say no, so we purchased our final deal of the day, went and ran some errands, and finished off at Thai Buffet.

We were the only ones there at that time, but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch (I think we arrived around 4:15-ish).  The buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself, but it is all you can eat.  Joann, the owner, described each of the dishes to us and piled our plates high with a variety of curries, as well as a bowl of soup and another plate of salad.  We couldn't say no to any of the dishes, they all looked super amazing.  And they were.

My favorite was probably the green curry; it wasn't as spicy as some green curries and it had green beans in it, which I love.  Everything tasted more homemade than "restaurant-y," for lack of a better descriptor.  I felt like I was in a Thai grandma's kitchen, and it was awesome.

As we finished our massive plates of food, Joann went back into the kitchen and prepared us bowls of coconut ice cream with mango, pumpkin custard, and sticky rice.  This might have been my favorite part of the meal, but it's hard to say because it was all so good.  I'm a total sucker for sticky rice, though.

Definitely will be back.  You get a great value for the price (even without a Groupon, the buffet is $9.99/person), with quality eats and very friendly service.</text></sentence><sentence id="903"><text>My main problem with the Cornish Pasty Company is inconsistency.  I've had pasties that were simply divine, and I kept going back.  Once I started getting ones that were a little icky, I just assumed they were having an off day.  I stopped going after my boyfriend and I got sick.  I really want to like this place, and I do like some things about it.  The crust on the pasties is always fab, but the fillings are hit or miss.  I always got either the Oggie or the Pilgrim, and the Oggie was more consitently good.  Once I tried the Pilgrim, it became my instant favorite since is had turkey and stuffing inside, and came with cranberry sauce for dipping.  But like I said, their lack of consistency, as well as the fact that I got sick last time I went, has made me not want to give them any more chances.</text></sentence><sentence id="904"><text>My boyfriend and I are super broke right now, so we're taking advantage of our Groupon credits.  We were hungry, and 5 &amp; Diner was one of the Groupon Now! options.  I was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there, but when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious, so I went for the waffle with strawberries, and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke.  As I'm writing this, he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy, so I'm doing that now before I forget.  (I had a sip, and I can verify that he speaks the truth.)  My waffle hit the spot, it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what I wanted.  My boyfriend cleared his plate, as well.  Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us.  All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food.  We'll definitely be returning soon.  As a side note, I had been here once before a long, long time ago, and had the patty melt and that was awesome as well.  

As a side side note, I don't know what the person who said the dining room smells like a bathroom is talking about.</text></sentence><sentence id="905"><text>The employees are for the most part very friendly, and right now they've got some sweet deals going on for candy.  2 sodas, 2 candies, and a popcorn for $5, or 1 soda, 1 candy, and 1 popcorn for $3.

They also have a new thing called Direct Access, where if there's a movie or game title that they don't have in the store, they can have it mailed to you within 2-3 business days for the same price as renting it in the store.  You can mail it back when you're done, or bring it back to the store for $3 off a movie rental or $4 off a game rental.

A while back, a coworker picked up a slice for me and I was not impressed.  I don't know what was wrong with me.  

I re-tried Venezia's on my lunch break four days ago, and I have eaten there every day since.  I brought my boyfriend there, and he is obsessed as well.  I am boring and usually just get cheese pizza, but my boyfriend always gets the slice of the day and raves about it, whatever it is.  I also got the Combo B last night, a slice of pizza with a small salad and a drink, and the salad was impressively good.  The Balsamic dressing was excellent, too.  Everyone should try this place out.  The pizza slices are huge, delicious, and satisfying.</text></sentence><sentence id="907"><text>I crave Ono from time to time.  I wish it was closer to my apartment.  I still swing by for some Chicken Katsu whenever I get the chance, because it is tasty and delicious and katsu sauce is addictive.  My boyfriend is more adventurous than me, and he literally always is in the mood to go here.  He especially enjoys the spare ribs, bbq combo, and the spam musubi.  We both love the macaroni salad...  I get why someone said there was too much mayo, and I guess by some standards it's a little plain, but that's what I like about it.  People who say the rice is boring are obviously right, but they're forgetting to put soy sauce or katsu sauce or whatever they want on it.  It's plain white rice, guys, what do you think it's going to taste like?  

They also have these super tasty canned Hawaiian beverages at the counter that we both highly recommend.  

Oh, and if you have a smaller appetite, definitely go for the smaller plate option.  My eyes tend to be larger than my stomach and I can never finish the full-sized katsu plate, but the smaller one is just right (actually still a little more than I can eat, usually) and it's only about $5.  Awesome.</text></sentence><sentence id="908"><text>Amazing wine list, fantastic pizzas with unusual toppings, and gnutella crepes for dessert.  It doesn't get any better.  Not to mention that the service is excellent and friendly, and the atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming, something that you don't usually experience in a place as hip as Cibo.  I get nervous going out to trendy places because I'm scared of getting dirty looks from rich people, but this was not my experience at Cibo.  Just sitting on their patio is a relaxing experience, what with the lovely foliage, glass of wine, and beardy waiter.  I always want to go back when I've got the cash.

I ordered the Chicken Katsu, which is a favorite of mine when it comes to Hawaiian food.  I was disappointed that it was especially chewy, and that they served it with BBQ sauce instead of Katsu sauce.  It just didn't taste quite right.  The lady working there wasn't particularly friendly, either.  I'll just go to Ono next time I hear the call of Katsu.</text></sentence><sentence id="910"><text>I am a couscous addict, and this is my go-to place.  Everything I've tried here is wonderful, though, and I love the attached market.</text></sentence><sentence id="911"><text>Best. French Fries.  Ever.

Also they have great onion rings, fried zucchini, hot dogs...  I don't eat burgers really, so I can't speak to those.  I am obsessed with their tuna salad, though.

I never thought I'd be ordering tuna salad sandwiches regularly from anywhere.  Tuna salad has a tendency to be that unpleasant gray or pinkish color, and have a tinge of fishiness to it, if its not fresh enough.  That is never the case at Chicago Hamburger Co.  This might sound strange, but their tuna salad is the most pleasant pale green color I have ever seen.  It's because they put relish in it.  Lots of delicious relish.  I am in love with their sandwiches, and although I used to devoutly order Polish sausages &amp; fries, I can't turn my back on my new love.  Not the first thing people think of ordering when they come here, but it's definitely worth a try.</text></sentence><sentence id="912"><text>Same deal as everyone else.  I bought the LivingSocial deal, and emailed them through their website as soon as I got the voucher.  I never got a reply, but I didn't mind because the instructions DID say to call a specific number to schedule, as opposed to going through their website.  About a week after my initial email, I called and left a voicemail at the number listed on the voucher.  Never got a call back.  Today, my boyfriend called to try and schedule a cleaning and the number on the voucher is no longer in service.  Their website has also been disabled.  I've requested a refund from LivingSocial.</text></sentence><sentence id="913"><text>I was here for a conference in April, and this was probably the most beautiful hotel I've stayed in. The staff and service was wonderful, and the provided food was more than satisfactory. Wi-Fi was a decent speed (except in the lobby), and was free to members who join their loyalty program.

The main issue I had was with the room I stayed in the first night. It faced another room, and therefore didn't have much natural light. I also couldn't leave the curtains open if I wanted privacy. The worst part was the noise. There was a low pitched humming from air conditioning equipment outside the room. The noise wasn't incredibly loud, but it was very grating and made it difficult to get work done or sleep. 

The next day, I asked for a new room. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and did not make me feel like a nuisance. I got a room that was much quieter, faced the street instead of another room, and had better natural light. I just wish this was true for all the rooms.

Overall, 5 stars for service, 2 stars for the first room, and 4 stars for the second room.</text></sentence><sentence id="914"><text>Tried out this new location, and wow! Amazing. I will be back for sure! Everyone is so friendly and service is spot on. Our meal was delicious and the music was great. Can't wait to try more things on the menu! This place is a winner!</text></sentence><sentence id="915"><text>Went to Wally's last night and all I can say is YIKES!!!!! The biggest disappointment I've experienced in a long time. What used to be this hidden gem, with the comfort of home vibe with perfectly cooked home cooked food and staff that treated you like family has now become just like every other restaurant in Scottsdale. Way over priced for poor quality of food, staff that doesn't care anymore, management that doesn't care anymore. My favorite waitress is gone, which I guess is no surprise seeing what the owner Chris did to this place. If I wanted to eat at Grassroots or Twisted Grove then I would drive a few blocks down and eat there. Wally's was something amazing, something special that is so hard to find in a restaurant these days.Now, it's ruined, now is disgusting, now it's a complete waste of your time and hard earned money. Don't bother trying it out, trust me. I will not be back to this one. I would much rather drive to the other location on Camelback that has remained the old Wally's. Way worth the drive.</text></sentence><sentence id="916"><text>I came into Wally's  last night for dinner with my wife and another couple. We were seated at a large round table in the corner on the patio. Our server Candy was amazing! What a gem she is. I have never had a more remarkable server. Seated next to us was a very large rambunctious group of ladies (if I can even call them ladies). The disgusting display of disrespect towards Candy was something I have never seen before. They were behaving like they were in a night club and to watch them bark orders at her and to treat her as if she was a slave to them was horrifying. But even more astonishing was how Candy carried herself through it all. That smile never left her face. I hope those women wake up today feeling completely ashamed of themselves, especially the one who did all of this in front of her teenage sons. I hope I never see any of the women in Wally's again and no server here ever has to go through what Candy went through.</text></sentence><sentence id="917"><text>Place was old looked dirty so I didn't bother ordering. I value my health so I won't eat there</text></sentence><sentence id="918"><text>They do a bad job of repairing flats.

Unbelievable duck tacos, sublime filet (really how does one make onion rings so good you want more? same for the grits, good grits-WTF?).  Fiance said lamb was so good she didn't know that lamb was supposed to taste like that.  Service great, attentive without being a pain.  Sit outside if you can, inside is noisy and small but smells really good as the kitchen is pretty open (no doors between it and dining).  This was top 3 in my memorable dining experience. ( Everyone has a bad day I guess, hence some of the bad reviews, but go. )</text></sentence><sentence id="921"><text>Great French cooking, cozy atmosphere, reasonably priced. Highly recommended.</text></sentence><sentence id="922"><text>We love Shauna's doggy day care! It's close to home, and her hours are convenient. And she offers half day services which are quite useful when you just need to run a few errands but don't want a crazy puppy on your hands when you get home! She has supplies, but we haven't bought anything yet, although we plan too. Also offers grooming service, which we haven't used either, but will in the future.</text></sentence><sentence id="923"><text>This place is as good as they say it is, and more. We've been there twice. Once with another couple who were grumpy about the whole experience and thus made our experience less than par. We were expecting the wait, but they were still irritated about it. They weren't nice to the staff, the staff thus wasn't nice to us. 

However, the pizza is absolutely amazing. So, we went back a second time, just me and my husband. Our experience was much more delightful. We enjoyed a bottle of wine during our three hour wait (and therefore were not drunk as one reviewer suggests) and excellent conversation. The ambiance is wonderful. The staff was very friendly since we were friendly to them. We were not rushed to eat quickly, although the pizza is so good it is hard not to shovel it in your mouth! Overall, we were quite pleased and look forward to going again. 

I'm not sure how one reviewer said it cost her $70 for her meal. Pizza's are $10 to $12, I'm sure soda isn't all that expensive, and salads range from $6-9. Must have left a pretty good tip! 

We've had the Biancoverde and Rosa, as well as the Spiedini for an appetizer. Delish. I just love this place and wish I could go more often. It's how pizza should be made!</text></sentence><sentence id="924"><text>I love local business. Especially when they have great customer service like Toshi's! 

I too have had the green tea smoothie, and what a delightful treat it was! I've also had their blended coffee, and iced coffee. Both far exceed the quality of that "S" coffee place. What's so great about the blended drinks at Toshi's is that they *shock* actually blend all the ice!! At the "S" place, I usually have chunks of ice at the bottom which greatly annoys me. Not so at Toshi's! And they always toast the bagels, which is great. They have limited outdoor seating, and they don't mind if you bring your well-behaved dogs. 

Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the most important part....they roast their own coffee on site!!! So you know that you are getting very fresh coffee. And you can tell....the taste is so smooth and not even a little bitter. 

Now what are you waiting for? You know you want to go to Toshi's!</text></sentence><sentence id="925"><text>Paradise is good. Wildflower is better. But there is no Wildflower in Surprise, so Paradise it is! 

As others have said, the tomato soup is quite delicious. I'm also a big fan of the salad with cranberries....but the name escapes me right now. The turkey wrap is average...lacking flavor. The breakfast quiche is also average. I think mine had been sitting out for a while, so maybe a fresh one would taste better? Cookies are good, but it is hard to screw up cookies. 

The salads are gigantic. Seriously, who needs a salad that big? I guess if you want it for lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day, what a deal! 

It can be a bit confusing the first time you are there since there are two lines, but you figure out that one is for the bakery, one is for the rest of the food, cafeteria style.

Why do I like Wildflower better? I think their sandwiches are better, and the soup as well. The only soup I like at Paradise is the tomato soup. The others are lacking. I need flavor! I like the ambiance at Wildflower better too, although there is much more seating at the Surprise Paradise vs the Goodyear Wildflower. 

Overall, not a bad place to get a fresh salad for lunch.</text></sentence><sentence id="926"><text>I should have read reviews before heading here. I had heard from several folks that this was a good place to eat, and we had heard that the wings were out of this world. Yeah, not quite.

First of all, the ambiance is not that great. Lots of small, loud children. 

The service was very average. We had three servers ask us if we had been helped yet, which I suppose is a good thing, but they all seemed very confused and not sure if we were their table. But good that they asked. Our actual server took quite a while to greet us, and of course he forgot my water. Brought the beer though! 

We started with wings and we wanted to split them...two flavors. At first he told us we couldn't do that, even though it says right on the menu that you can. He made it seem as though he was doing us a favor by splitting them for us! They tasted more like chicken fingers and not wings. Way too much breading. 

I had the California burger, hubby had the fish and chips. The burger was overdone, but I expected it would be so I ordered it medium to get it to medium well. It was well done. Thankfully I didn't order well done! Otherwise it wasn't bad for this kind of place. I also order the potato chips as a side since they make them there. The chips were burnt.  The fish was seriously over breaded (apparently they like doing that here) and way too big. The baked potato and cole slaw...very average. 

Now all that being said.....our bill was very cheap ($33) and that included two beers, wings, and two entrees. 

Want cheap food and average service? Go here! Otherwise, try somewhere else.</text></sentence><sentence id="927"><text>We went here for a belated Valentine's dinner. It was fantastic. Parking was a pain, but we eventually found a spot. They seated us immediately (we had reservations) and our server was very attentive. They immediately brought out bread (delish) and water. Not long after, our wine arrived. Speaking of wine, don't be scared when you see the wine list...I didn't see any wines by the glass, only bottles, so I simply told the server what I wanted, and there it was! 

I had the tagliatelle (sp?) pasta with wild mushrooms. SO good. I'm a big fan of earthy tasty yumminess, and this hit the spot. Why can't I do this at home?? Oh, and the soup... divine! The special was potato and leek soup. Perfectly smooth, must have been strained several times to get it this smooth. Very comforting. Hubby had the mac &amp; cheese for an ap...YUM! That Vermont cheddar is just too good! He had the pork chop for his entree, and I will never be able to make pork chops at home again. Oh well! He thoroughly enjoyed it. For dessert we had the Iron Chef apples, which were perfect. We were pretty full by this point, but these three adorable little tasty apples were just the right finishing touch.

The second best part of our night (the food was first, of course) was meeting Mark Tarbell! I tried not to act like a fool, but I watched him on Iron Chef, so it was cool to meet him! He was very friendly, very down to earth, and seemed genuinely concerned about our experience. He was walking around to all the tables...great chef! 

So for a nice night out, you can't beat this place. Enjoy!</text></sentence><sentence id="928"><text>We had a fantastic experience here! We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on, it was still very pleasant sitting outside, even in June. The wine list was extremely affordable - most between $25 and $60. For Scottsdale, this is a steal! We shared an appetizer and a main entree. The appetizer was delish. Grilled bread (perfectly grilled, not so hard that it hurts your gums) with three spreads - an amazing goat cheese and marscapone, eggplant, and hummus. Also, they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter. For our entree, we shared the fish special, which was a sea bass with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and spinach. Fantastic. The service was also great. 

I've come to expect any service in Scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasn't! Maybe we were lucky, but I enjoyed our experience.</text></sentence><sentence id="929"><text>Mmmmm.......bread......

Oh, sorry, I'm supposed to be writing a review. Wildflower is easily our favorite place for lunch, and breakfast too. This place is always clean, always busy, and ordering is always easy. 

We usually get the same thing every visit, since it is so tasty. We both get the potato cream cheese soup, no matter what time of year (yes, it is that good!), I get the chicken and feta, and hubby gets the BLT. Even at half size, these sandwiches are plenty to fill up on. And, if we feel we can spare the extra calories, we will get a cupcake to go. YUM! I've also had a salad, can't recall which one, but it was fantastic as well. Sometimes we'll also get a loaf of bread to go, and we've varied the kind, all have been great.

Now breakfast...ah, that was just divine. I got the lemon ricotta melt in your mouth pancakes with fruit topping. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! And I got the apple sausage on the side. It was a little dry, but no matter since I was so full on the pancakes. All I needed was a mimosa.... Moving on, hubby got the banana walnut pancakes, which werer also oh so scrumptious. 

So, we love supporting this place, and think it kicks Paradise's butt. We are wishing and praying that they would bring one to Surprise, although that might not be good for my waistline....</text></sentence><sentence id="930"><text>I love the ice cream here! Course, I've never seen baby roaches, thankfully. While the place isn't spotless, it is clean. I love the decor... very charming, and the employees are always friendly. I've had shakes and sundaes here, both have been very good. Also, they sell "pup cups"...a frozen yogurt treat for your four legged kids! My dogs love these pup cups, and at $1.25....it's a great treat for them when it is so hot out! And it is a local store...so all the more reason to support it!</text></sentence><sentence id="931"><text>I've been to Babbo's several times since it is so close to my house. My two favorites are the Pasta Martini and the Gorgonzola Salad. The bread is excellent, and I've had no issues with the wine, so maybe I've been lucky? I've also had their pizza, I can't recall which one, but it was excellent with peppers and goat cheese. The ambiance is great as well, and prices are very reasonable. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the service has been sketchy at times. But, it isn't so bad that we won't return. Overall, a good place.</text></sentence><sentence id="932"><text>I have mixed feelings about this place. I love the concept, but the owner seems to only provide good customer service to his "important" customers. I've been in here several times, and each time I felt as though he didn't really want us there. My dogs are well behaved, and I've promoted his ice cream socials (and told him so) but I still felt as though I was not welcomed. I may not be as regular as some customers, but I still deserve good customer service. I'm not willing to pay high prices if I don't get good treatment. I want to support his business since he is local, but apparently he doesn't want my business.</text></sentence><sentence id="933"><text>We checked this place out to compare prices to Target and other grocery stores. What I found....prices are essentially the same. Since I enjoy shopping at Target so much more (it is my happy place!) I will continue to shop at Target and the grocery store closer to my house. The good points....It is clean and well organized, and in the frozen section the lights don't come on unless you are standing in front of it. Nice touch...keeps the food in a dark cold area, while conserving energy. But, Walmart just isn't my thing, and if the prices aren't cheaper, then off to Target I go!</text></sentence><sentence id="934"><text>We've only had Bronoc's once. We had it delivered, and it was average pizza. The sauce was too thick and too much tomato flavor, the crust was average as well. It tasted more like certain chain pizza stores that I avoid, but it is a step up from them since their cheese tasted better. But I am a major pizza addict (usually make my own) so I am very particular. Their customer service was good, and the pizza was hot when it arrived, but the taste just wasn't that great. It's been a while since we tried, maybe we'll try again sometime and see if it has improved.</text></sentence><sentence id="935"><text>Ok, so service isn't always the best. The workers can often be clueless and even rude. Luckily, I know Target very well, so I don't need these workers! I can find it myself! The cashiers are hit and miss. Sometimes they don't even mutter "hello", but whatever, I'm at Target. Yeah, it's my happy place. They always have fun stuff and great prices. Things are always well stocked (at least the workers have that part figured out). I can easily drop $100 here even though I just went in for toothpaste. How? It's one of the mysteries of the world, I suppose. So when I'm trying to save money, I don't go here! If I really need something, I do not, repeat, do not get a cart, but a basket! That way I can't fit much in my basket. 

I think Target is a girl thing. Guys don't really get it. But if you are a girl, you get it. It's Target.</text></sentence><sentence id="936"><text>We've been to Tokoyo lobby twice. Both times were great. I'll start by saying I gave it four stars instead of five because it is small, small, small inside and the ambiance isn't fantastic. But the things you must do for good sushi! 

I can't recall for certain the name of our favorite roll, but I believe it was the Glendale roll. Deep fried goodness is all I can say! I know, it isn't traditional sushi, but I just can't do raw fish! Nuff said. We tried two other kinds which were good as well, but the deep fried goodness overshadowed the other ones and I have erased them from my memory. 

The pot stickers were ok, not fabulous. The green tea was great and came in cute little tea pots. I haven't had sake here and I don't know why, since I usually get sake. Guess I'd better head back for some more sake and sushi!</text></sentence><sentence id="937"><text>Vogue Bistro is by far the best restaurant in Surprise! Why, you ask? Oh so many reasons! Let's begin...

1) It is not a chain restaurant! It is locally owned by a well trained chef. 

2) The Food. Ok, maybe this should be number one, but with the dominance of chain restaurants in Surprise, I think it is important that it is not a chain. But the food is FANTASTIC. I haven't had a thing I didn't love. My favorite is the Vogue Burger. It's big, but not so enormous that you have no idea how to eat it. The toppings are perfect, not overwhelming, and the meat melts in your mouth. All that yumminess for only $8!! What a deal!  I've also had the sweet potatoe fries (make sure you ask for the dipping sauces), the garden panini, the chicken panini, and the chicken salad (yes, we've been there a few times!) All were fantastic. 

3) The alcohol. No, I am not an alcoholic, but this is worth mentioning! The drinks here are great. I usually get wine, while my hubby will get beer. Both lists are great and reasonably priced (a great white wine for $6/glass). Also, the martinis are fabulous. They shake and pour at your table and they have many specialties. But, what I love most about the martinis is that they are sweet, but not blast of sugar sweet. Often when you order a sweet martini you are blown away from the sweetness factor. Not here! They are just perfect.

4) It has very chic decor. Lots of outdoor seating which isn't great this time of year, but is fabulous when Arizona has nice weather. When does that happen again? Moving on...

5) The manager and owners are awesome. We haven't been there once that they didn't stop by for a chat.

6) It is local! I am a huge supporter of local businesses, which can be extremely challenging in Surprise. 

Ok, now for a couple minor negatives. These are not significant enough to drop the star rating, in my humble opinion. 

1) Sometimes the servers can be a bit lacking. I think this is because the restaurant is still new and still learning. So, we overlook it and instead take the extra time to enjoy good conversation. 

2) It can be crazy busy. I guess that isn't a bad thing necessarily, but we can be spur of the moment and decide to head to Vogue. Luckily we can usually find a seat at the bar and order there. 

So there you go. The best restaurant in Surprise....you will wonder what the heck it is doing in Surprise. It is more Scottsdale-like, but without the snobbiness (no offense to you Scottsdale folk!).</text></sentence><sentence id="938"><text>Ok, normally I like to support local over big chains, but I've always had a good experience at this PetSmart. The cashiers are always friendly, the store is clean, and most of the time I can find what I need (minus one time they were out of vitamins). I wish they had more organic and natural products, but since I feed my dogs mostly fresh food, this isn't an issue. They have a great selection of holiday items, so I am looking forward to what they have this year! And I've had no problem returning items if I needed to. Plus, they have adoption drives!</text></sentence><sentence id="939"><text>We absolutely love Sprouts! We shop here almost exclusively (only at other stores for things that we can't get or the price is too high to justify...but that includes very few items). The produce is always fantastic (and cheap!!), then meat is so tasty and fresh, and the cheese....oh I just love the cheese section! The cheese is cheaper than what you will find at other grocery stores...we did a price comparison. I know when I shop at Sprouts I am not getting overly processed, full of preservatives. I am getting fresh food!! What a concept, huh? And the bulk section is fantastic. I love being able to buy spices and flour and anything else you can think of (especially the chocolate covered toffees!!) in just the amount I need. Then it is always fresh and I don't have to wonder how long I've had that dried rosemary! And, it is a local Arizona store, which makes me even happier.</text></sentence><sentence id="940"><text>I went to Tomo with a very large group (around 18 folks, we had a reservation). Things didn't start out so good...the manager wanted all of us to pay cash because he didn't want to split the checks! After we explained that none of us had brought cash (seriously, who pays with cash anymore?) he left for a bit, and then came back and said we could split the check. So, I believe they were just being lazy, since they ended up splitting the check anyway. If they had wanted us to pay with cash, they should have informed us when we made the reservations! Poor management. Overall the serves did a good job though after this incident. 

Moving along to the food. The green tea was unlike other green tea that I have had. It had a nutty taste to it that I didn't care for. Perhaps that is more authentic? I don't know, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and didn't drink it. The miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly. Hubby and I shared the gyoza and the spider sushi. The gyoza was crunchy, but not too crunchy, and came in a boat. Nice presentation. The sushi was good too. Nothing out of this world, but good. Another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great. It had scallops, mussels, and shrimp. I didn't try it though, so can't say for sure. And the hot sake was great. Always good to have hot sake with my sushi. And to finish it all off...the green tea ice cream. Now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening! Nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. 

Bottom line: Don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip.</text></sentence><sentence id="941"><text>He did good work on my SV650 ABS, General maintenance and handle bar conversion.  Planning on getting more work done in the future.</text></sentence><sentence id="942"><text>Not for me.  They sit you on a recliner, wet your feet while massaging your head (felt like they were shampooing me) -- very uncomfortable position for my back.    Then the masseusse asks you to turn over while fully reclining the chair and works your back with the elbows.   I did not like it at all, felt like it was too rough on me and am already showing a couple of bruises.  I paid $36 for the 1 hour including 30 minutes back massage.   Too loud, no privacy, cells ringing, employees talking in a foreign language, just too disturbing and I also have a headache now.  I am an expert on Swedish and Thai massages, on a massage table with the masseuse using her hands and a complete silent environment but this was a far cry from relaxing.  The masseusse was a sweet lady but the experience was not good at all</text></sentence><sentence id="943"><text>This place is a train wreck. The owner and management should be embarrassed to have such an under trained staff. Also the quality of food is all over the place, sometimes good and sometimes horrible.

Food is always good and they give you massive portions. All the staff have always been really friendly and quick with service.</text></sentence><sentence id="959"><text>The food is good.

It's great Pad Thai, Curries, etc. If you're looking for Thai food, and you're in Robinson, this is it.</text></sentence><sentence id="960"><text>Kiyoshi is always a good place if you're in the mood for sushi. Place is nice if you go in person, or they deliver which is even better. We've always had excellent food from them.</text></sentence><sentence id="961"><text>This was ok. Not great but not horrible either. The sushi is good for a sushi fix, but I don't think it's as fresh as Saga normally is. The service was bad. I'm sure it was our section or something. But two tables that were seated after us were served before us. We're not that picky so it didn't bother us too bad, but it was at least 10 minutes before we got drinks. Other than that, if you're looking for a chain sushi place to get some ok food that will hold you over then this is good for that.</text></sentence><sentence id="962"><text>This place has been a fantastic find for us in Moon! Pizza is awesome. Better than the other options around here. Same with the other pasta dishes. We would highly recommend this place. Delivery is quick. We've always been happy!</text></sentence><sentence id="963"><text>Selma's is really good, not BBQ pit-masters great, but very good for Pittsburgh. The pulled pork is fantastic. I highly recommend the Big Pig Wrangler (add a hot sausage to the pulled pork sandwich)! I see other reviews looking for BBQ perfection and this isn't it. But if you're craving some BBQ and living or visiting here in Pittsburgh, this place will do the trick.</text></sentence><sentence id="964"><text>This is my favorite place to eat real breakfast. No fake eggs. No garbage Sysco food. They have excellent pancakes and change them up throughout the seasons. The owner is fantastic. The food is fantastic. What else can I say!? The only bad thing is if you're not there early, prepare to wait because its tiny inside and everyone wants to eat there.</text></sentence><sentence id="965"><text>I can't believe there's no other reviews on here for Hometown! This is the best pizza in the Moon area period. They are the go-to for us when we want awesome pizza. We do like some of the other options around here as well, but Hometown Pizza is by far the family favorite.</text></sentence><sentence id="966"><text>These guys are awesome very nice and polite. Found out that last time I replaced my windshield through safelite they had broke the trim panels never told me about it ( I had gone to them on 4 separate  occasions all 4 times there was always something wrong). The guys here at advantage pointed it out to me and got me some new ones and put them on for me. Can't say enough good things about advantage not pushy in anyway nice and quick will be taking my car to them for now on. And I will be telling friends and family about them. Thanks again guys!</text></sentence><sentence id="967"><text>Been here a couple times now. I always have Dany cut my hair she is awesome very nice and easy to talk to and she knows what she is doing. I trust her 100% with my hair. Everyone that works here is great, everyone is nice makes for a great atmosphere.

She wanted to go short and that's exactly what she received! Karen was her stylist and she was phenomenal! Very welcoming and sweet towards my niece! However, when we walked in another stylist was dying her hair and her kids and significant other were receiving haircuts from here when clients were waiting. A bit of time passed and all of a sudden another stylist started to fix his own hair up. So at this time, 2 stylists were doing their own hair. As time goes on, the male stylist starts to smoke his E-Vape IN THE STUDIO!!! The work they do is quite incredible, however they need to work on professionalism.</text></sentence><sentence id="969"><text>The most excellent golf instructor is Shane Crosley.

My wife had the Halibut and I had the Filet Mignon we both found our meals delicious, flavorful with a flair, and served hot!   The artisanal dinner rolls were piping hot and we particularly enjoyed the seeded rolls.  My Filet was well seasoned and covered with blue cheese crumbles that I crave.  The hollandaise sauce for the Filet and asparagus was a nice addition.  If you are nearby, take a risk but know that our gamble paid out a jackpot of a meal.</text></sentence><sentence id="971"><text>What a disappointment!  Bought a water lily on Mother's Day and it's not growing.  When I called about the guarantee, was told I never should have planted it that early so the guarantee is void.  When I bought the lily, specifically asked the clerk if it was OK to plant that day and he said it was.  Now they won't replace the plant because I should have known not to plant so early.  Tricker's, really?   They're living up to their name.</text></sentence><sentence id="972"><text>Absolute worst nail salon experience of my life, I will never go back. I urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as I got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn't clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt "oops" then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut. Next I told her I wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as I'm watching her file my nails I have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval. After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say "that's not almond" uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says "hurry up" now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies "oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though" can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right. As a bonus not even two weeks later I had a nail break off, ridiculous.</text></sentence><sentence id="973"><text>Excellent food and service very friendly servers would seriously recommend the tuna chips and soft buns.</text></sentence><sentence id="974"><text>The desserts were OK.

I originally took my vehicle to the insurance company recommended collision 'experts' and was told it would be $600.00. Figuring this was ridiculously low I took it to Sudden where they concluded the damage was more extensive and proved it to the insurance company (over $2000).

I just found out there are different classes, and the latest one is cake decorating.  Never in my mind did I see myself use fondant...but here I am now.  I've make flowers, animals, and figurines.  And it's not just a one day course.  It's once a week for several weeks.  They start you out on basics and each week the techniques get more difficult.  The fondant days are the last days.  I can't wait until my next class!</text></sentence><sentence id="987"><text>I have been going to the Draft House for many years and have always enjoyed the food and the experience, but lately the food hasn't been that good and the new staff in the dining room has alot to be desired.

His name was Jeffrey Demoure and was great.

This was my first visit to APDC and the place was just buzzing with energy and the sweet smell of pork. Order the bison tongue as an appy and it was outstanding.  My friend had the seared foie gras and he kept rolling his eyes in delight. The bottle of wine was a beautiful Cote du  Rhone Quartz which paried very well with the meal.  For main, I had the maple pig's foot.  The presentation is shocking... the whole trotter in a cast iron pot with all the trimmings.  The taste was insane.  Skin was sweet and crunchy while the meat was juicy and savory.  The mash potato at the bottom soaked up all the essence from the dish. Very indulgent.  Brought 2 cans of duck in a can and flew them back to Vancouver.  Split one can the next night with 4 senior citizens and they were very impressed.  Gave the other one to a friend and she had hers 2 days later and it was still amazing.  Verdict:  These cans do travel so long as you keep them cold.  They are good for at least 3 days.  How do they stuff all the duck and foie gras with all the tirmmings in a small can?</text></sentence><sentence id="998"><text>I'm from Vancouver and have tasted all the ramen shops from Kintaro to Sanpachi.  Vancouver provides a wide array of ramen shops within a 1 mile radius within the downtown area.  While on a business trip in Toronto, I went in Kenzo for a late night bite and ordered the Tonkotsu ramen.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the soup was steaming hot and had lots of death.  It was every bit as good as the Vancouver ramen shops.  Very impressed.</text></sentence><sentence id="999"><text>Excellent!!!! He came to my place and detailed my Yamaha R1 an my dirty super moto husky.  He did such a great job. The kind of work I thought only I would do with my own bikes.

They got their food before us, the place is dirty. We waited at our table for over 10 minutes before ever being acknowledged (I'm pretty sure it would have been longer if we didn't go up to the cashier trying to order), the table we had to run and claim ourselves. The yelp location of the place is completely wrong so a couple of u turns had to happen. Waited forever for the food after waiting a lifetime to even put our order in. While waiting watching more people who arrived after us get their food.  The food is not worth going through all the crap.   And the check was wrong.</text></sentence><sentence id="1001"><text>This place is the bees knees and beyond the cats pajamas! Marlon the bartender is amazing and needs a raise ASAP! And Angela?!

Definitely try their eggplant and ANYTHING with pesto, it's delicious and the proportions are perfect for lunch! The seafood bisque is rich and creamy. If your feeling sweet try their monkey latte.

My only peeve is that this place is a little awkward to get to and it's tucked away on the side of a freeway and corporate offices.</text></sentence><sentence id="1005"><text>BEWARE!!  People at the store were helpful, but they charged my card the minute my order was placed online (on a weekend, when they couldn't be reached by phone), despite my explaining in the comments that I wanted to confirm the color before the order was completed.  They did call to discuss the color, and even sent photos to help me make a decision (especially since shipping to California was VERY expensive).  I got back to them - via e-mail - that I appreciated their help (which I did) but that I was not going to complete the order and, instead, continue to look for a color closer to what I was after.  I said that, if I decided to go with the alternate they suggested (different type of yarn and color), I would get back to them but, for now, I wanted to keep looking.  They responded by saying to let them know, and how nice the other yarn was.  Two weeks later, I get a message that they've shipped yarn to me!  I immediately contacted them, saying I had canceled the order - that I had told them I was going to keep looking and had not accepted their suggestion, but their response was that it'd been two weeks so they automatically shipped.  I'm guessing they've sent the yarn I initially chose online....I have no idea!  They sent me no warning - no confirmation that they were going to ship....and that's when I discovered they'd charged me for the order the minute it was placed - NOT when it was shipped like every other company I've done business with online.  I'm EXTREMELY disappointed and will never do business with them again!  Beware if you give them any credit card info!  They'll use it whether you want them to or not, and the minute they have it....even when nothing has been settled or even shipped yet!!  To return it, and pay shipping twice would cost more than the yarn so I've been FORCED to make this purchase, even though they led me to believe I would not be.</text></sentence><sentence id="1006"><text>I have been eating here for years.  While the ambiance is not great, the food is very good and the prices are very reasonable.  I have probably eaten every item on the menu, lunch and dinner, and never been disappointed. 

I am a bit of a Thai aficionado, originally from NY.  Bangkok Ocha is better than most.  I have had better Thai at significantly higher prices in Florida and California.  There are a couple of places in an Atlanta that are as good but overall this is a terrific "once a week" (at least) spot.

While I understand reviews are subjective; the details in some of these reviews, what was ordered and the comments, suggest input from Thai posers and dabblers rather than addicts.

I completely understand and accept that my sense of Smokeless Joe's greatness is directly attached to my own love (LOVE) of a good pot of mussels.  Their African Peanut soup is also great, which makes me assume that the other stews and soups are too.  Additionally, I find the beer list here suits my taste better than any other I've found in Toronto so far, and the fact that the beeristas are willing (and required) to leave their bar fortress and go to the fridge at the back of the store makes me feel grossly indulgent asking for some of their bottled speciailties.

The food is delish- favs include the kale &amp; sweet potato wrap and the bbq chicken wrap.  My issue is with the juices... $11.25 for fresh pressed pesticides.  You cannot charge that much for a juice made with conventional (NON organic) produce and position yourself as a health conscious restaurant catering to that clientele.  People who can afford a $12 juice are smart enough to care where this guy sources his ingredients from.

Great atmosphere (cool bar, outdoor pub tables, red leather booths inside) and our server (Paul) was phenomenal.  Expansive bar and a huge selection of beers on tap, including some very enticing samplers.  No blue cheese olives for the martinis (bummer, since that's a signature drink at Olives).  Prices are high, as to be expected in City Center.  The seafood is the freshest I've had in all of Vegas- it's flown in every morning.  Their live bar comes by the piece- east and west coast oysters and delicious jumbo shrimp cocktail served on a gorgeous platter over ice and garnished with sea plants.  The duck buns were incredible- the meat was sweet and tender and the buns were like soft little pillows!  I've been dreaming about these ever since and I plan to come back for them!!  Lobster rolls were delicious- sweet rolls lightly buttered and grilled, then stuffed with lots of sauteed lobster meat.  The coleslaw they were served with was the best I've had.  The moules frites (mussels) came in a rich, delicious curry broth and even the fries were perfect.  We also had the pickles (three house-made varieties, thought they came with bottled mustard and not stone ground).  The smoked salmon quesadilla was incredible- with buttered yukon golds and fried capers.  They also do a fabulous bread pudding that is served with fresh whipped cream, salted caramel ice cream, and a delicious toffee sauce.  The bread pudding itself was the perfect texture and is one of my favorite desserts in all of Vegas.  This place rules, I cant wait to come back and try the carvery menu- chose your meat, sauces and bread.  Definitely recommended.</text></sentence><sentence id="1028"><text>BEST DONUTS EVER.  Seriously... they're amazing.  Huge selection of every variety imaginable- IF you come early.  Favs are the apple fritters (they let you chose from lighter or darker ones, depending on how done you like them), and their old fashioned buttermilk.  The donuts on the top two rows of the case are vegan,  but you'd never know it.  Their chocolate glazed cream filled (soymilk) and glazed raspberry jelly (gelatin-free) are crazy good.  I dream of these things.  Hole-in-the-wall smack dab in Chinatown.  The owner &amp; her husband are as sweet as can be.  I only wish they were open 24 hours!</text></sentence><sentence id="1029"><text>Love love LOVE Sambalatte!  Vegas has been lacking cafes like this one! I go here multiple times a week and everything has been perfect.  They have many different coffees brewed through various unique processes that make a French press look run of the mill.  Cappuccinos and lattes are full bodied and strong, and they have designs in the foam.  Great hot tea selection available in french press pots, and a delicious iced green yerba mate.  They have sandwiches (good caprese one, heated and served with a side of balsamic) and lots of desserts- including minis (napoleon, eclair, tiramisu cups, etc).  They also have gelato and sorbet, and my husband's all time fav- affogato (gelato with a shot of espresso poured over).  The atmosphere here is charming and warm, and they are open till 10pm wed-sat.  Service is excellent, they always walk upstairs to bring me my drink and are super friendly.  There is free wifi and an entire long table downstairs with multiple plugs for laptops.  Only negative is that I wish they stayed open later on weekends, especially for Vegas 10pm is early to close!</text></sentence><sentence id="1030"><text>Marche Bacchus has a gorgeous view, but the food does not stand up (as is often the case).  The quality was average at best.  The lobster croissant that everyone raves about was terrible- a stale croissant unnecessarily toasted and filled with lobster meat that tasted fake.  It was shredded and almost had the texture of "Krab".  Very unappealing, and a very poor rendition of a lobster sandwich.  The signature bread pudding was also sub-par, burnt on top and dry throughout.  Definitely not worth the pre-ordering and 20 minute wait.   Service is disappointing, however the wine store is lovely and has a nice selection at reasonable prices.  The view is great and they have misters (major bonus in summer time), but next time I will be trying Garfield's next door in hopes of a better meal.</text></sentence><sentence id="1031"><text>Great pet boutique.  They carry all the hollistic brand foods, including the standard Wellness Formula and the grain free variety.  They have a great selection of treats, both bagged variety and behind their bakery counter.  They also have a nice selection of toys, harnesses, clothes, and bath products.  I love this store- prices are reasonable and staff are always friendly and knowledgable.  Highly recommended for anyone who feeds their dog/cat healthy food and treats!</text></sentence><sentence id="1032"><text>I am updating my review of Luv-it... still the best frozen custard in Vegas (by a mile).  However, it is super lame that they use styrofoam cups in this day and age.  Polystyrene is not accepted by recycling (Waste Mgmt) in Las Vegas, it's a possible carcinogen, it's made with petroleum, it is clogging our landfills, ETC. (google it!).  With so many eateries going green and switching to eco-friendly packaging, I wish Luv-it would too.  This guy sells a ton of custard every day and I cant imagine how many of these cups he goes through.  You gotta get with the times!</text></sentence><sentence id="1033"><text>MAD LOVE for the slider truck.  What a great concept, I am so glad this place is getting the attention it deserves.  Finally we have a gourmet mobile restaurant!  The weekly schedule is posted on their website www.slidinthru.com and on twitter.  My fav is the caprese (grilled eggplant, mozarella, toms, basil, balsamic).  They also have a pulled pork slider, a beef one with tzatziki and feta, a bbq one with carmelized jalapenos, and a classic with cheddar, bacon and special sauce.  Supposedly they are going to start doing a chicken one too- fantastic news for me and my husband since we dont eat red meat!  Their buns are great and everything has a really nice smokey flavor from the grill.  They have regular fries, and really good sweet potato fries (tossed in cinnamon and sugar).  Only thing I wish they had is unsweetened iced tea, and I am looking forward to more chicken and fish specials.  Prices are reasonable, ingredients are high quality, and these guys (especially Ric) are total chillers.  There is always a line and your sliders are made to order, so be prepared to wait a couple minutes.   If you haven't been here, be sure to check it out.  I cannot give this place enough praise, mad props for a guy in his 20's acting on a really great idea- Vegas SO needed this!</text></sentence><sentence id="1034"><text>Mad Hatter cupcakes are not good.  I have tried every cupcake bakery in Vegas and these rate at the bottom.  They use oil and poor quality ingredients and their cupcakes look very unrefined (almost unappetizing).  This would be a cute place for a cheesy kid's birthday party because you can customize your own cupcake (cake, filling, frosting, and topping).  Unfortunately their cakes are tasteless and the frosting is overly sweet.  These dont hold a candle to The Cupcakery, Sprinkles, or any other decent joint.</text></sentence><sentence id="1035"><text>Olive's is a fantastic restaurant, exactly what you'd expect from Todd English.  The flavors are somewhat mediteranean and they've got a great menu.  Their cocktails are fabulous, I love their white peach belini and my husband is crazy about their dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.  The bread basked comes with fresh baked onion foccacia and two kinds of olive tapenade.  They have some really good apps, including a great ahi tartare and some really nice flatbreads (one with proscuitto and figs, another with mushrooms, and a great classic tomato-basil-mozarella).  Favs on the dinner menu include the scallops (perfectly seared, served with risotto), the butternut squash tortellini, and the chestnut ravioli (served on a bed of creamed spinach-heavenly!).  Do not skip dessert here- they have a souflee that is crazy good.  Flavors change but the strawberry is incredible, so is the vanilla.  My husband and I order two, that's how delicious they are.  Service here is always great, very attentive.  I recommend sitting on the patio, it's much more private and has a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and water show.  Definitely make reservations or you could be waiting 2 hours for a table.</text></sentence><sentence id="1036"><text>Great coffee shop in the Henderson part of town.  They have really good iced tea, avaiable in 3 flavors- including unsweetened peach black tea and passion berry (amazing!).  Their coffee is fair trade organic and varies daily.  They have a small selection of pastries and some breakfast and lunch options (vegan friendly).  They have a good breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, beans, cheese, fresh avocado and lots of spinach.  There are comfy seats and a bookcase full of books, however they are only open till 8pm.  Awesome eclectic staff, super friendly and knowledgeable about their coffees.  I wish they had a larger/better pastry selection and were open later.  We need a place in Vegas that is comparable to the living room in SD, and this is the closest I have found so far!  I so wish they'd open one in the Summerlin-ish area!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1037"><text>Original Pancake is one of the best breakfast places ever.  They are a chain, and their locations in Rancho Santa Fe (SD), Palm Desert, Chicago, etc are all way more charming than this one.  That said, breakfast here is always consistently delicious and the service is great.  Their omelettes are fluffy and baked with the ingredients inside, almost like a souflee.  They do a great dutch baby, german apple pancake, and a dutch garden (dutch baby topped with veggies and cheese).  Their pancakes are my favorite- thin and flavorful, you can smell the buttermilk.  They come in every flavor, including seasonal pumpkin (amazing!) and fresh strawberry with whipped cream (during summer months, with fresh not canned whipped cream).  They also have classics like eggs benedict, corned beef hash, and amazing swedish pancakes (thin like crepes).  They also have a location in GVR that is newly expanded, for people on the Henderson side of town.</text></sentence><sentence id="1038"><text>Hugo's is a Vegas landmark and an old school experience not to be missed.  Let me be perfectly clear that it is in the Four Queens Hotel, a dive hotel on the old strip with the parking lot to match.  That said, when you step down the stairs into Hugo's Cellar you are in an entirely different environment.  Ladie's are greeted with a rose and the setting is very romantic (dark wood walls, candlelight).  Service is excellent and they have some great sommeliers.  They have a very good wine list and serve complementary bottled water, as well as a nice bread basket with cheese-toasted lavash and rose-shaped butter.  Their salads are the highlite, included with your meal and freshly prepared on a cart at your table.  Toppings like hearts of palm and bay shrimp and delicious dressings- try the orange walnut vinaigrette.  You are served an intermezzo sorbet to cleanse the palatte (raspberry on a mini cone).  Dinner is very traditional- chicken, fish, and steaks served with a potato and vegetable.  Not especially gourmet or cutting edge, but very old school classic and part of the experience.  They offer traditional desserts such as bananas foster prepared tableside, and they bring a complementary dessert of chocolate covered strawberries, dried figs, and apricots served with whipped cream.  This restaurant is great and remeniscent of old Vegas, definitely a must try.</text></sentence><sentence id="1039"><text>This place is super clean (major bonus points!) and they have great vegetarian pho.  I am mostly restaurant vegetarian and it's hard to find pho that is not either a beef or chicken broth.  Their's (I think called tofu/vegetable) is very flavorful, salty, and comes with a platter of very fresh veggies to arrange in your soup as you like.  My husband and I each get a large bowl- it is huge and takes forever to eat!  Their fresh spring rolls (the cold ones) are good, but not the best i've had.  The sweet sauce that comes with them is great.  Major bonus points for a place that offers a veg pho on par with the traditional beef one!</text></sentence><sentence id="1040"><text>Glazier's is pretty middle of the road for me. Let me start off by saying that the store has a very strong, strange odor that has lingered since they first opened (my husband says its tolerable, I find it hard to bear). The layout is nice and the store looks impressive compared to most regular grocery stores (Smiths, Vons, etc). They have a large produce selection at very affordable prices. Lots of exotic fruit, vegetables, and peppers that cannot be found at conventional grocers. However, their herbs and most greens are less than fresh and their selection of organic produce is lacking (and way too expensive when compared to Trader Joes, Whole Foods, or even Vons). They have a great selection of ready made food, but few healthy options. Pizza, ice cream, sushi, pasta salads, pasta entrees, vegetable and starch sides, etc. Some of what I've tried has been good, including salmon stuffed with spinach and pesto, green beans almondine, mixed vegetable rice, broccoli with peppers, etc. They also have a nice looking coffee and tea bar and a good selection of gourmet bread (La Brea Bakery olive bread, jalapeno cheddar, pain rustic, organic whole grain, etc). They have a huge bakery with donuts, pastries, pies and cakes at shockingly low prices, but nothing even remotely health conscious. Salad bar is run of the mill and cant hold a candle to Whole Foods, but again the prices here are incredibly reasonable. They do have an organic/natural food section but they do not have organic eggs, meat, etc. 
I could not do my regular grocery shopping here, but this place is great for specialty items and anyone shopping on a budget. It is far better than a Walmart or Smart and Final and I like the fact that it's family owned. Their produce selection is worth a trip alone. I also find myself coming here when I get home late and don't want to cook- their ready made and pre-packaged food is available 'till they close at midnight. I wish they'd offer reusable bags, a discount card, and a juice bar among their ready made food stations. I also wish they'd refresh their magazines- I feel like I am in the twilight zone when I stand in line and see covers from weeks ago.</text></sentence><sentence id="1041"><text>This place is fab... they have every single toy imaginable- from the typical pet store brands to more boutique style game/brain teaser toys (my dogs are currently obsessed w/ hide-a-squirrel!).  They also have food, treats, leashes, harnesses and more- all discounted.  Love this place.</text></sentence><sentence id="1042"><text>This is one of the best places for boba tea in the city.  They have an extensive menu featuring the usual flavored black and green teas, slushes, snow ices, and smoothies.  Their prices are more reasonable than most tea houses in Chinatown, the service is friendly, and the place is clean as can be.  There are always people getting take-out drinks here and there are a couple tables inside and out front.  Favs include the strawberry milk tea and passion fruit black tea, both with boba.  My husband loves their fruit slushes.</text></sentence><sentence id="1043"><text>Pet Pros is a nightmare, I cannot emphasize this enough.  Their dogs come from puppy mills, they were taken from their mothers far too soon and many dogs in the store have kennel cough and other illnesses due to improper care.  The staff, as expected, tell you the dogs came from reputable breeders and have papers, which means nothing and is standard in this industry.  This is where people go to purchase "designer dogs" for astronomic prices, without doing the research or investigating this industry.  A simple search on google will tell you all you need to know about petstores, puppy mills, and the store itself.  Go to petfinder.com and search for a rescue dog that fits your needs, or check out local animal shelters.  If you are looking for a specific hypoallergenic dog, check out breed-specific rescue organizations (ie. poodle rescue).  
Dont breed or buy while shelter pets die.</text></sentence><sentence id="1044"><text>Tommy Bahamas is great.  I have eaten at their restaurants in Maui, Palm Desert, and here in Vegas- they are all consistently fabulous.  Service is always attentive and they have a great happy hour in the bar (there are also comfy booths if you dont want to sit at the actual bar).  Happy hour is I think from 4-7pm weekdays- discounted apps and drinks, and some really good fish tacos.  Their bread is in the shape of a crown, served hot with a sweet cinammon butter.  Great apps- favs include the coconut shrimp, cayman lollipops (chicken drumettes with mango bbq sauce), goat cheese with mango salsa and flatbread, and the ahi poke.  At lunch they have really nice salads and some great sandwiches, including a beer-battered crispy fish sandwich with tarter sauce and honey roasted onions.  For dinner, they have great seafood and a really great stuffed chicken (herb cheese and roasted red pepper cream).  Dessert here is a must, the pina colada cake is good but the butterscotch pudding is incredible.  Most desserts are available in small sizes, though they dont display this on the menu so you'll have to ask.  I highly recommend this place, especially for dinner on the patio on warm summer nights.</text></sentence><sentence id="1045"><text>Tea Station is my favorite place for boba tea in Chinatown.  Their prices are definitely higher than most of the competition, but they do offer a discount on all to-go drinks.  And lets be real, some of the other tea houses in the area are just plain creepy.  The menu is extensive (over 10 pages of tea) and the atmosphere is nice.  This place is very clean- major bonus points, especially if you've frequented some of their local competition.  Tea Station is always packed, especially at night since they are open late.  My favs are their passion fruit green tea with boba, or the iced mixed fruit tea (although this one is super sweet).  My husband likes their fruit slushes.  This is a great place to get work done during the day (free wifi) or meet friends at night.  It is very popular for takeout drinks, in fact I always see 5-0 popping in here for their late night boba fix.  Service is reasonably friendly but definitely on the slow side, especially during busy times.  I would not recommend the food (their squid balls were inedible and smelled like a mixture of hot garbage and the ocean, though perhaps they are an acquired taste!).  I recommend this place based on their atmosphere, tea, and the fact that they are open late.  This is definitely more of a traditional tea house than your average take-out boba shop.</text></sentence><sentence id="1046"><text>Layers is the best bakery in Vegas, without question.  This place is the closest thing Vegas has to a high quality bakery on par with SF or LA.  They use high quality ingredients and everything is always fresh, never sitting out more than that same day (like other lame bakeries in the area!).  Favs include their butter bars, cupcakes (flavors change daily), and sticky buns (get there early, these go super fast).  They also do beautiful celebration cakes to order (and have some avaiable in store every day).  I only wish they had more French pastries (almond croissants, napoleans, eclairs, brioche, etc).  That would bump them up to 5 star status!</text></sentence><sentence id="1047"><text>Dupar's is all about the pancakes- go here for them, they're incredible.  Fluffy, drizzled with butter, &amp; served up 24/7!  Solid breakfast here... bruleed oatmeal w/ fresh fruit, &amp; eggs florentine among my favs.  They also have a great tuna melt, split pea soup, carved turkey sandwiches, pies, etc.  This is my go-to spot after a late night downtown, and for breakfast when I'm willing to make the trek down to Freemont.  Everyone I've taken here loves this place- they have an expansive menu and those pancakes are the absolute bomb!!  Best in Vegas, maybe even the best ever...</text></sentence><sentence id="1048"><text>Vivido Gelato is good, but not authentic Italian gelato.  Large selection of flavors, but they're lacking some traditional staples (straciatella, fior de latte, etc) and need more fruit options.  Prices are high, especially given the small servings (two small gelatos for $8).  Also, they limit you to two flavor samples per person, which they announce when you walk in.  This just seems really cheap of them and totally rubbed me the wrong way.  There is something in their gelato that makes it very stretchy, almost gummy.  The mint was pretty good (but colored with green dye), blood orange was okay but not very flavorful.  I will probably go back if I crave gelato again, but only because there is nowhere else in the area.</text></sentence><sentence id="1049"><text>This is the best dog store in Vegas.  The selection cannot be beat- they carry all the hollistic dry and wet foods, as well as treats.  Great selection of Wellness Formula, which is what I feed my dogs.  They also have a huge variety of toys, chews, clothes, beds, leashes, harnesses, bath products, etc.  They will special order anything you want that is not in-store.  Unfortunately I live clear across town from this store, or I would shop here far more often.  As far as pet stores in Vegas, this is as good as it gets.</text></sentence><sentence id="1050"><text>Hedary's is legit Lebanese food.  Really yummy mango juice (more like a nectar and not overly sweet).  Solid hummus, good tabouli and Greek salads, and an incredible lentil soup.  Falafel are flavorful and not overly fried, although the sandwich was a bit on the dry side (needed more veggies/sauce to balance out the grittiness of the falafel balls).  Pita bread alone is worth the visit here- sweet, puffy, and served hot out of the oven.  I definitely want to come back for their lunch specials, and to try the shrimp scampi (ordered by the table next to us- smelled and looked amazing!).  Hummus, pita &amp; that lentil soup are better here than anywhere else in the valley.</text></sentence><sentence id="1051"><text>This is THE premier alpaca store in the valley, if you're into this sort of thing.  I happen to love various furs- from Mongolian Lamb, to sheepskin, to alpaca- and this store is a fur heaven!!  I take trips out here with friends when we want to update or add to our collections.  I love that no animals are killed for this fur, and the quality is exceptional.  They have fab pillows, rugs, and various accents for the home- as well as some pretty cute sweaters.  I've also gotten some handmade moccasins and a horseshoe hook here, designed by a local artist in Boulder City.  Prices are on the high side (which is typical for alpaca), but the men that work here (owners, I'm guessing) have been accommodating at lowering the price (especially when you buy several items).  If you're looking for Alpaca, this is the place to go!</text></sentence><sentence id="1052"><text>I'm a fan of Rachel's.  Like another yelper said- Vegas needs way more places like this!  It's a gourmet little breakfast and lunch spot, you order at the counter and there are some cute tables in and outside.  They have breakfast burritos, pancakes, sandwiches, wraps, burgers (beef, chicken), soups, pastas, and huge salads (spinach, curry chicken, cobb).  There is a nice selection of veg options and everything is fresh and high quality.  Pastries could be much improved on and I wish they served breakfast past 11 on weekends.  Mad props for having fresh brewed tropical unsweetened iced tea.</text></sentence><sentence id="1053"><text>Earl of sandwich is a great concept and the menu is super enticing.  Prices are fair, quality is average.  The turkey is in the form of cold cuts (not roasted like Capriotti's) and mirrored the quality of a Quiznos or- worse yet- Subway.  The bread here is baked fresh to order and is fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside- yum.  The All American sandwich was okay, but again the quality of the turkey was off putting.  It had cranberry sauce, buttermilk ranch, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheddar.  The fellow reviewer who said this sandwich trumps the Bobbie must have had a few too many, I mean really.  The tuna melt, however, was great- very simple with just tuna salad and melted cheese, but delicious.  If you like tuna melts then this is the place for you (that might have been a 5-star sandwich!).  Potato salad was average and they have a selection of other salads and kettle chips.  There is also an assortment of baked goods, unfortunately the chocolate cupcake we tried was yellow cake mix with chocolate frosting (lame!).  The earl gray lemonade was refreshing and delicious, and I loved that it was something different.  Major props for having good vegetarian options (veggie sandwich with feta and peppers and a caprese).  I'd probably come back for the tuna melt and an earl gray lemonade, but I am shocked that this place has better ratings than the much superior Tom Colicchio brainchild Witchcraft (which uses vastly superior ingredients and has more exciting offerings).  Mad props that it's open 24 hours.</text></sentence><sentence id="1054"><text>Sababa has moved up to five star status- strictly based on their falafel.  Let me be perfectly clear, I have never had anything else here.  However, this is the best falafel in Vegas- and I have tried many.  The falafel and hummus comes in a pita pocket filled with tahini, tomatoes, pickles, cabbage, cucumbers, and lettuce.  They have an incredible green parsley hot sauce (crazy hot!) and their falafel is moist all the way through (not dry in the center like many others).  The falafels are fried to order and the sandwich is made in front of you.  Still wish they had fresh brewed iced tea, but I usually get takeout anyway.  This place is Israeli owned and about as authentic as it gets.</text></sentence><sentence id="1055"><text>I love Red Velvet Cafe, for their baked goods alone.  I have never eaten the food here, but have visited many times for tea and cake and often pick up their baked goods to bring home.  The owner's wife does all the baking herself, and it is clear that great care has gone into developing her recipes.  My favorite is the red velvet cake, which looks like a large cupcake and is topped with a deliciously sweet frosting and a whole strawberry.   They also do a delicious chocolate peanut butter cake, also in the shape of a large cupcake with a moist chocolate cake and rich peanut butter frosting.  The best part about these cakes is that they are under 200 calories, vegan, and free of any saturated or trans fats.  She does not use artificial sweeteners or make things that are low fat but still unhealthy- these cakes are all natural, preservative free, and taste delicious.  I highly recommend this place for their baked goods alone, and I look forward to trying their food.  The menu features sandwiches, pastas, salads, and an assortment of vegan meats and cheeses that are all made on site.</text></sentence><sentence id="1056"><text>Went back to Fresh 52 today with the desperate hope that they'd expanded and added a few more vendors.  Unfortunately you can literally walk through the entire place in under 5 mins, so it's hardly worth the drive across town.  However, there are a couple places that will keep me coming back (at least on occasion).  The bread from Bon Breads is solid and they have lots of varieties (white chocolate batard, multigrain, pretzel rolls, ciabatta, etc).  Also the salsa and chutneys from Miguel's rock!  The salsas all have a great kick, and they have a mango one too.  They have jalapeno jellies and an amazing apricot jalapeno chutney that is super flavorful.  A couple places have come in since summer and a couple have gone out- there is still a decent sized produce stand but its strange that there was only the one vendor.  There is a face painting station, a dog store, and a booth that sells Scentsy.  There is also an organic, loose leaf tea stand and another with baked goods (although there were very few options).  There is a crepe stand too, but they were mostly dessert flavors rather than breakfast options.  I wish this place was 10 times the size it is, but it's still worth checking out and most of the vendors were solid.</text></sentence><sentence id="1057"><text>This review is for the spa only.  It's a fab property that I've enjoyed coming to for years... unfortunately this place is pretty dead lately and the staff are not friendly.  My masseuses have all been good but nail techs not so much.  If they are struggling for clients they need to up the ante and make it a great experience worth the drive.  Also, the pool was closed due to it being a weekday (so we couldn't use the full spa amenities, which is why we go).</text></sentence><sentence id="1058"><text>Benjrong is a great neighborhood Thai place... my husband and I have been getting take-out from here on a weekly basis since they opened and have never been disappointed.  The service is excellent and the restaurant could not be cleaner or more pristine- the entire kitchen is on display (major bonus!).  Favs include their vegetable egg rolls (love that sweet, clear chili sauce), tom yum soup, pad see ew, pineapple fried rice, pad thai, and the currys.  Their hot sauce is great, so are the lunch specials.  The food does not compare to L.O.S. or Komol in terms of the flavor or complexity, but everything I've had has always been fresh and delicious.  I definitely recommend this spot- it is way above average for a local Thai place and is not filthy, dingy, poor quality, or lacking flavor- like so many other local places...!</text></sentence><sentence id="1059"><text>Five stars for the falafel at Amena!  Similar in style to the falafel in pita at Sababa (hummus, cabbage, pickles, tomatoes, etc), but even better.  Their pita is fluffy &amp; delicious, like soft little pillows.  Falafel are bright green, flavorful, and the perfect size.  You order at the counter and when it's ready, you come up and chose what veggies you want inside.  They also have a good homemade hot sauce on the tables, and a great selection of bakery items including a really great baklava.  Best falafel in pita I've had in Vegas.  I wish I'd tried this place sooner... the creepy Trader Joe's strip mall/dive-y location was throwing me off.  I should have trusted Misty's review because I've been missing out!  And like she said- they sell their pita bread!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1060"><text>Familia is in a strip mall on Durango and delivers to the surrounding area super fast.  Good service &amp; they always get your order right.  Love their garlic knots, greek salad, and pizzas (cheese w/ ricotta &amp; basil is our standby).  They also have calzones and stromboli.  Good cannolis- thick cream with cinnamon and chocolate chips, filled to order in their homemade shells.  Spumoni ice cream for sale by the tub.  Way better than Marcos or some of the other chains in the vicinity!</text></sentence><sentence id="1061"><text>Love this sushi spot, I've been coming here for the past few years.  They're in Town Square across the street from H&amp;M, next to Yogurtland.  Atmosphere is warm and trendy and is why I often prefer Kabuki to other places in the area.  Comfy private booths, tables, sushi bar, and an outdoor patio.  Usually crowded from happy hour (great specials) to closing, but I've never had to wait more than 10-15 mins.  Extensive cocktail menu, decent wine selection and several flavored non-alcoholic drinks including sweet mango iced tea and mint lemonade.  Edamame comes with all sushi orders.  Good miso soup and house salad with ginger dressing, decent seaweed salad but not my fav.  Lots of apps, including fried eggplant and calamari.  Large selection of specialty sushi rolls, fav is the Lotus on Fire roll (spicy tuna, jalapeno and lotus root on california rolls).  Extensive menu with lots of pictures, and lots of non-sushi items including teriyaki, noodle dishes, soups, seafood, etc.  Fresh fish, great service &amp; atmosphere!</text></sentence><sentence id="1062"><text>Settebello is definitely the best Italian pizza i've had outside of Italy.  Their crust is bubbly, chewy and delicious.  They have some nice salads and a yummy focaccia (this is really just their pizza crust baked with some oregano and sea salt, but delicious none the less).  Great sangria, coctails, and espresso.  Unfortunately, their iced and hot teas are lipton (lame!!).  The margherita pizza is delicious, as is the four cheese (with gorgonzola and ricotta, yum!).  Their cannolis are good, traditional with dried fruit and chocolate chips but the shells and cream were both a little thick.  Their gelato is also good, but very airy and not dense like traditional gelato (great flavors though, including a seasonal apricot).  Comfortable atmosphere with tables and booths (props) and well worth the drive across town.  Five stars based on their pizza alone- delicious!</text></sentence><sentence id="1063"><text>5 stars for the chai latte at Tipsy- best chai I've found in Vegas.  Spicy and not overly sweet, and major bonus points for being able to order it with almond or soy milk.  The chocolates here are also great- the s'mores bar is graham cracker-y, peanut buttery amazingness.  Definitely a spot worth checking out.</text></sentence><sentence id="1064"><text>Lucilles is really great BBQ, definitely the best in Vegas by far. They're located in The District in GVR and the atmosphere is really great, very southern. Expect an insane wait here on weekends, but it's well worth it. They have some of the best sweet tea I've had, served in a huge maison jar. The bread basket is stuffed with buttermilk biscuits and apple butter, and they have some really good apps like pulled chicken sliders on sweet rolls, fried green tomatoes with red pepper cream, and fried pickles (spears, not chips served with remoulade). They have delicious salads (one with sauteed shrimp, one with smoked salmon and a peach vinaigrette, one with BBQ chicken and onion strings). They have the usual meat platters with brisket, tri tip, ribs, chicken, etc. They have a good blackened catfish and some incredible sandwiches- my favorite is the BBQ chicken sandwich with melted cheddar, onion straws, and lots of field greens on a french roll (they also have yummy potato buns). Sides are awesome- good mac n cheese, peanut slaw, sweet potato fries, cheese grits, etc.  Mad props for being one of the few BBQ joints that also caters to vegetarians- veggie burger, salad, or a really good marinated portobello sandwich with melted cheese and garlic mayo. Desserts include fruit cobbler, pecan pie, peach bread pudding, banana pudding, and red velvet cake !! There is a separate take out area near the entrance that absolutely kills it. Service is great and prices are reasonable, especially given the huge portions and quality. This is the only place my husband and I go when we crave BBQ, and we often take out of town guests here for the great atmosphere and food.</text></sentence><sentence id="1065"><text>I bought my car here late last year and have had good experiences with both their sales and service staff.  They are knowledgeable about all the models (including mine, which was new for 2010) and they do not leave harassing messages or turn into stalkers if you need some time to think before making your lease/ purchase.  They always loan me a Lexus rental during servicing, even if I did not reserve one in advance.  The waiting room here is about as nice as one could be- flat screen, comfy couches, drinks, bagels/cookies (my husband creeps on their cookies like they're going out of style).  Thorough car wash (inside and out) with every service.  When an update was needed for my car's computer system, they came to my house and installed it.  Unfortunately they are the only Lexus dealer in the entire Valley, so they aren't exactly wheelin &amp; dealin here.  I hear they are opening another location in the Henderson area, which i'm sure will be a huge plus for people on the other side of town.</text></sentence><sentence id="1066"><text>The Molto Vegas Farmer's Market is one of my favorite things to do in this city.  This is an indoor famer's market, located on Dean Martin in a warehouse.  It runs on Thursdays from 11am-1pm, with a previewing for chefs at 10am.  I found out about this place by eating at one of Batali's restaurants- it's all through word of mouth, they dont advertise.  There is lots of fresh produce including some nice heirloom tomatoes, herbs, lettuce, interesting citrus, etc. though it is not all organic.  Their prices are high, as to be expected.  They do not carry dairy for sale to the public, aside from cheeses sometimes (goat, gouda, and a heavenly buratta that sells out immediately).  You have to be a member of their profit sharing group to purchase the eggs.  There are a couple other vendors that sell coffee, dates, and some hydroponicly grown herbs.  This market is very small and even mediocre compared to what you would find in California or Seattle, but it is much better than the other farmer's markets here in Vegas.

If THEY determine I somehow have these mystery bottles of water that I never received I will not be refunded. AVOID THIS SERVICE! TRUST ME. Everything about closing the account was (and still is) a nightmare. Do yourself a favor and do business with someone else! Some of the WORST customer service I have seen in Las Vegas to date. Shame of businesses that know they are below standards and continue to operate without making changes to provide better service. I hope all the negative reviews catch up to you and you see a decline in your profits because I am guessing that is the only way you will fix the issues.</text></sentence><sentence id="1078"><text>Let me preface this review by stating some facts. I lived here for 6 years. We ALWAYS paid rent on time, were respectful neighbors to the community and responsible tenants. These apartments were great..... 5 years ago. What happened? If you are debating renting here, let me fill you in on what you are really in for. 

2 years ago the apartments sold to new owners. That was the downfall. Instead of taking care of upgrading appliances, upgrading the landscape for renters or properly managing maintenance requests; they chose to upgrade the front office and future tenant center to increase curb appeal. They chose to close down the main pool.... right before summer. The pool was closed for months. They offered no reimbursement whatsoever. When you sign a lease you are entitled to the amenities that were provided to you when you were shown the apartments. The mailbox lock hardly ever worked and was left open a lot. Car patrolled security (non-armed) that once existed, must have gotten cut because they were no where to be seen in past years by my eye. Apartment building security lights were left burned out even after MANY maintenance requests, which was CLEARLY a security issue. This last December, there was an armed robbery.... AT THE MAILBOX at 10pm! Two men jumped from the nearby bushed area with a gun and robbed a tenant. We no longer felt safe and it was (in my opinion) because of poor management with caring about the safety and well-being of it's tenants that were already moved in.

Once you're in, why do they have to care about your satisfaction and safety? You signed a lease and they know they have you locked in. In the last 2 years, our apartment has been flooded by the upstairs unit 3 times! The first was a faulty bathtub connection but the second time was due to a maintenance repair error (as stated by the maintenance man) and was repaired VERY poorly and took over a week to complete while we couldn't use our main bathroom. The third time (see video and pictures) was also a faulty connection to a washing machine after it had recently been replaced. The managment never apologized once for the inconvenience to flooding our apartment for the third time in two years. They also NEVER came back to fix the damage it left on the walls and pillars, as evident by the water stain on our ceiling and paint that was bubbled. The foundation for the apartment is shifting as well. There were huge cracks in our walls from who knows what. Our sliding door on our patio would no longer shut correctly because the door frame was warped from the building's unrepaired structure (multiple times we put in requests to see what was going on with this. Nothing was fixed, just noted on our maintenance record) 

Sounds great, right? There's more. So you can see how unprofessional they are, but how about unethical? They started bribing tenants to put in "5 star" reviews on yelp to get entered into raffles for iPods and other prizes. They also, recently, started asking new tenants to put in "5 star" reviews to get some fees taken off their move in costs. If you ran a sound business with great satisfaction, you wouldn't need to bribe people into giving you 5 star reviews, would you? Shame on any business that does this. And last, but not least, we are (at the time of writing this review 4/15/16) still waiting for our security deposit. Like I said, we ALWAYS paid rent on time, for 6 years! And the one time we are LEGALLY due our deposit IN FULL within 30 DAYS of moving out (Nevada States Law NRS 118A.242), it has not arrived. We have called Jessi, the manager, multiple times and never received a call back from her. We received one email stating the refund has been "processed" but still no update on the status or postage date.They tell us they are short staffed and sound really sad on the phone but guess what? You are a business! Act like it. Don't make excuses, just fix issues. If I were to tell them 2 years ago that I had some personal problems and couldn't pay rent (which never happened, just example given) would they let me pay late or maybe within 7-10 business days? NO! They would have fined me and eventually evicted us if they didn't receive payment. These are not even all the issues we experienced but this about sums up our time there. It is not right that businesses don't care about the tenants after they have signed a lease because they know they have them locked. We should have moved out 2 years ago, that was our fault for staying so long. But we have now moved into a new apartment with better appliances and staff, 24hr armed security car patrol, maintenance requests that were taken care of within the same day... all for the same price we paid there! Do yourself a favor and look around and judge for yourself. I can tell you that we feel like Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption when he finally swims through the sewage drain and is free. Good Riddance, Vintage at the Lakes. And no, you can't buy a 5 star review from me.</text></sentence><sentence id="1079"><text>Cool little breakfast spot. Staff was really great.

- Fresh tasting food. A lot of Mexican food around town (and elsewhere for that matter) taste like it's been sitting around for hours waiting to be served. This almost always seems fresh.
- Fair prices! The prices for items and combos are great! Great happy hour too.

I recommend the rancho style tacos and (of course) the fajitas!

We got a late night dinner there and everything was horrible. First, it looked like it was closed. I am sure that the employees do this so people just drive away (I wish we did). Our order was wrong. Cold and super greasy fries. 

and the chicken sandwich was RAW! If you think it's a pain to cook chicken late at night because it takes awhile SAY YOU ARE ALL OUT! But never rush it.

This place needs to either be under new management or torn down. Start over with a place that gives a damn.</text></sentence><sentence id="1085"><text>I have been only volunteering at Toys 4 Smiles for a few weeks now but I can definitely say this is a great group of individuals that are donating a lot of time and energy to do something simple yet profound, make children happy. In a society full of high-speed entertainment (internet, cell phones and video games) fueled by a "I want it yesterday" mentality, it is refreshing to see something like Toys 4 Smiles. These toys are very simple, yet very high quality. It is rare in this day and age that a child will receive a toy that not only was HANDMADE for them but also requires them to use their imaginations. The way I think of it is that maybe some of these kids getting theses toys don't have a lot of people in their lives that make them seem "worth it." Well, I am hoping that some of these kids will get these toys and understand that a stranger took the time to make them by hand and that a stranger CARES. They are worthy of it and deserve it. It's a simple thing but if that message reaches some children that message could possibly affect a life. 

I encourage anyone looking to donate some time (doesn't matter how much) to give them a call and head on in and help make some toys!</text></sentence><sentence id="1086"><text>The hidden gem in Summerlin! 

This is a little restaurant (separated from the gaming side) hidden by the Lake in Summerlin. We didn't expect much from this place but after reading the great reviews and it being so close to our home we had to try it.

IT WAS GREAT. Here's why......
- Friendly staff! Always smiling and it's a relief to see people working in F&amp;B in Las Vegas that look like they are genuinely happy.
- The food. I'm sorry to say but I didn't expect great food. I was mistaken. Everything we tried was pretty dang good. The breakfast burrito was great. The club sandwich was huge and great tasting. The quesadilla was maybe my favorite I've ever had, with the peppers inside, the crema on top and it wasn't greasy at all. Corn beef hash was also good. The eggs and bacon may be the downfall for them. They seem like they are instant and the bacon was majorly overcooked. Looking forward to trying the chicken pot pie and some other things there!
- Price. It is VERY fair.

This place feels like a little local spot back home for us. So for that and the other reasons I listed, we will be coming back...... a lot. =)</text></sentence><sentence id="1087"><text>I am somewhat new to comics. I read some as a kid but really just started getting into them more as an adult. 

I have been in some comic book shops where it feels like being a newbie is a bad thing and they don't really want you there. THIS ISN'T THAT TYPE OF PLACE!

The staff is great! They answer all my questions without some weird superiority judgment. (they also remembered me by name after only a few visits) They set up a subscription box for me to keep track of the comics I want. They matched some prices I found online for some back issues I needed. They call around to other stores to track down the issues you may need. They have a decent rewards card that when you fill it up you get a free book. The toys there are pretty fairly priced as well.

Overall, great place!</text></sentence><sentence id="1088"><text>I recently planned my birthday party here complete with trying the "MONSTER PIZZA CHALLENGE" I have to say from the time I called to ask about having my party there to the time we left that night the staff there was awesome! It's so rare to find genuinely friendly staff in Las Vegas. They had our reservation perfect and gave my party it's own side of the restaurant. There was games for the kids. The pizza was very good. Roberto is a great manager (owner?) and he accommodated us with every need we had, which included staying open a little late. Do yourself a favor and go and support a Las Vegas business that deserves your money, time and appetite. 

ps - all you other Las Vegas business owners, Go to Graziano's Pizza and take note of how to treat customers right.</text></sentence><sentence id="1089"><text>Great food. Great service. Definitely go try this place. I haven't tried the egg&amp;tofu but have had everything else and it's great. Fries are awesome!!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1090"><text>LOVE THIS PLACE!

Basically, this is chipotle/subway of pizza. Great and fair prices. Quality ingredients. Daily specials. Friendly staff. Beer.

Great concept. This place really does things right! The white pizza was great, as well as the classic margherita pizza.

The downside I think for this place is the..... NAME. It's hard to associate "custom built" with pizza, especially if you are driving down the street and can't see the "pizza" part written very small. To me, this seems like a great name for a cabinet maker or something.

We love this place and hope it survives the rough Las Vegas restaurant market but it doesn't ever seem that busy and I think the name is what's hurting it.  

What helps this place? Word of mouth and Yelp reviews!</text></sentence><sentence id="1091"><text>We came here on a Friday around 5:00.

Vanna demonstrated such care and love for Cody and we were comforted when we were away knowing he was in the best care.  Vanna has a knack for taking care of multiple dogs at a time, and Cody always had so much fun with her and the other dogs.  She walked her guest dogs many times a day and Cody got more exercise and play than he did with us.  When we returned Cody was always so happy and healthy and he looked like he'd just had a dream 'dogcation'.  Cody would always get excited when we walked towards her place, it was clear he really enjoyed his time with Vanna and her other guest dogs.  Vanna's rates were the lowest in the area too.  If you want your dog get the best exercise, food, love and attention, and a chance to live and play with other dogs (they are pack animals), I very highly recommend Vanna's services.  Cody had a much improved quality of life because of Vanna.</text></sentence><sentence id="1094"><text>First of all, these are amazing cupcakes! A little slice of heaven.

We arrived around 5 PM, and it was not busy. We were not greeted or seated for a good 5-10 minutes after walking into the door. The waiter did not seem to know much about the menu or he did not bother to explain any of it to us, we ordered some appetizers. Most of the food was bland with no flavor. Their spring rolls are not authentic spring rolls, most likely spring rolls catered for non-asian. Let's see, it took about 10 minutes to get seated and the appetizers came out 15 minutes after we ordered, but after finishing out appetizers and waiting approximately 20-30 minutes after our mains had still not arrived. So we asked the waiter how much longer our main courses would take, he looks at us then looks down at his hand which had our orders. He did not put the orders through! This was horrible service and he did not even apologize, he would looked annoyed anytime he looked at our table. Keep in mind that when we walked in there was only 2 occupied tables. It was already getting late and we decided to wait for the main course. The pho had the weakest broth I have ever tasted. Everyone else food was either cold or bland.

Then when we got our food the waitress came over and said she forgot our onion rings. So upset with the dining experience. Food was alright but still didn't need to take over an hour to get everything to our table. Thought this was a burger place?</text></sentence><sentence id="1111"><text>This was an excellent restaurant with a great ambience and lovely food. I was in town looking for a great place to eat which would serve fresh food with high quality in reasonable portions, and I stumbled upon this place. The service was great, the food was excellent quality and taste and minimal disruptions. I ordered the kale and arugula salad which I did not realize had bacon on it. The server did not even question my concern and right away replaced the salad for my convenience and satisfaction. I was so impressed at how she did not even question it and said no problem we will just change the for you to make sure you are happy with your food choice. I would really recommend this place</text></sentence><sentence id="1112"><text>Food great. Service horribly. Not enough staff to handle a small amount of customer. Had to wait forever for each step of the process. Be prepared to have to shave again during the meal</text></sentence><sentence id="1113"><text>Slow and understaffed.  Looked past me and took known guy behind</text></sentence><sentence id="1114"><text>Always quick and efficient! The price is right, every time I go (probably twice a month) I do the $15 wash, which includes exterior and interior and my car always comes out like new within 15min!</text></sentence><sentence id="1115"><text>I am not usually a fan of burritos, but wow I am obsessed with their breakfast burrito and all of their pastries are fantastic. I've definitely found my favorite place to grab breakfast or lunch or just a sweet treat!</text></sentence><sentence id="1116"><text>One of my favorite places to get a drink and a great meal largely because you can't bet the beautiful and relaxing atmosphere! You can sit right next to the golf course while watching the sun set over the mountains and service is always fast and friendly</text></sentence><sentence id="1117"><text>Service and atmosphere was really great and had a fun twist on decor. Food came out quickly and the portion size was large. Got the la vaca loca that had the steak. Flavoring was great, but ordered with the green sauce and I didn't really taste or see it in the burrito so maybe it was forgotten? So instead I loaded it with the side of salsa given and side of guacamole that I ordered and omg so good! Salsa and guac was awesome and so fresh. Definitely will be going back for a nice quick lunch</text></sentence><sentence id="1118"><text>This place is absolutely amazing and service outstanding! The atmosphere is relaxing with stunning views which makes this place one I keep coming back to again and again. Prices are completely reasonable and I believe a little cheaper when compared to the other high end spas in the area. The restorative organic massage is my favorite since it uses hot towels to massage your back and includes a scalp massage and foot scrub!</text></sentence><sentence id="1119"><text>Of course the food and drinks were perfect like always! Cocktails are a must and you can't go wrong with any one (especially their Mai Tai). We always do a full meal of appetizer, entree (the snapper, steak salad, or fish tacos are my favorites) and dessert when we go because everything is just so good! Hands down my favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale area; you just can't pass up a beach paradise atmosphere in the desert.</text></sentence><sentence id="1120"><text>After shopping around for cushion replacement not only did I get the best price and customer service here, but Valerie even came to my home at no additional charge to measure everything. She even offered to discard the old ones for me &amp; if they're in good enough condition they donate them to dog shelters to be used as beds which is such an amazing idea! They had the best selection of fabrics from different manufactures including Sunbrella, Tommy Bahama, Outdura, and Pindler. Valerie was also really helpful to narrow down choices that helped me stay in budget, but as she mentioned you can start here and the sky's the limit!</text></sentence><sentence id="1121"><text>Loved the loose leaf tea. Meal wasn't my favorite, but I got an egg dish and apparently they are more known for sweet breakfast dishes such as pancakes etc. The two people I went with both got pancakes and they enjoyed them</text></sentence><sentence id="1122"><text>I had such high high hopes for this place. Truly. I too toured the facility and I like Marc T was in awe of the facility and the cleanliness everything was so new and properly stored, I felt like if I had to put my baby somewhere this is what I would want.  I did in fact enroll my child for the summer program the rates are high but I figured someone has to pay for the amazing aquarium that was mentioned in the previous review and it included snacks and 'breakfast &amp; lunch' so I dove in!! 

With MUCH push my husband finally agreed to let me pay the fees which included a enrollment fee of 150 plus the first week, (you are charged weekly on Fridays) I chose to put my child on an easy-pay system where they would pull out weekly for his tuition Mistake 1. The first week they charged us our normal tuition plus enrollment fee (183 for 3 days mon, wed, fri &amp; 150 enrollment) then no less than 3 days later they charged us again! This being our first week my husband and I were a little taken aback but we figured eh maybe a fluke,  after addressing the issue with  Kaylee we were told "no worries, well note your account and we just wont charge you for next week" great I thought lets move forward then 3 days later ANOTHER charge now I was getting a little annoyed.

I don't know your financial situation but the tuition is high so these accidental charges were starting to hurt after the 3rd accidental charge. Again I went to the office and spoke with Angela the finance director and I told her we were a little concerned we had only been attending one week and already had been charged for 3 weeks plus enrollment. I kindly asked for a refund as I didn't mind waiting for the first accidental charge to catch up, I was more than a little peeved about the other charges. I talked to Selena and she told me that I needed to bring in my credit card statement that showed the charges...Lol I wasn't lying. Don't they keep records of what they are charging peoples cards!!
Angela tells me SUUUUURE you can have a refund in 6-8 weeks!!!! 6-8 weeks because your finance department cant keep its records straight? I snatched up my easy pay document so fast she had a paper cut!!! 

So I let it go AGAIN (really didn't have a choice we were 3 weeks in on charges) I continued to bring my son. When I would pick up my son the room was so hot I could smell the children's sweat but this is AZ heat so I figured man the AC must be working hard to keep this place cool and I would bring him at 8 so maybe they had just turned it on. 
One of my biggest concerns was the child to teacher ratio, were talking 15 KIDS TO EVERY ONE TEACHER!!!! Why? because that's the minimum that the state will allow wouldn't you want your child to go to place that goes above a beyond the bare minimum? It was a ZOO when I would have to get him early. There was no less than 35 kids in the class at any given time. Great! I thought a great way for him to socialize with children his age. They called me less then 1 hour into his class saying that my son had attacked a little boy, when I went to get him thinking my son had mauled a little boy I was very upset he had never hit before, when I walked in he was sitting alone (I assume time out) which I am okay with but when I asked if the little boy was okay I looked he had a scratch the size of a sewing needle, not downplaying what my son did he should never hit but they are 5!!! They are learning they are going to get into scuffs.  My son came home on the 3rd day with a large scratch on his forehead I didn't say anything because I get it, they have scuffs and boys can be a little rough. After the 2nd time I chose to remove him from the program, just in time in my opinion I just got a letter saying they needed another 150  for supplies. Lol
Across the hall from my sons class was the infant room, my heart would break to see the infants crying with no one trying to console them. As a mother I know that some have no choice but to put their child in daycare and work but would you want your baby to be screaming because they aren't required to have more teachers in the class?. It just made me so sad to see this daily.   

The staff is SUPER UNFRIENDLY I actually stopped smiling to them because you know that feeling when you smile at someone and they look a you like you have gone mad smiling at them!!

In conclusion if you feel the need to enroll you must be okay with the following:

1. Your child must NEVER make a mistake like get a little rough with another kid, if you work plan to miss a few days because you will be asked to come and get him

2. Have an endless supply of money because they will need it. 150 enrollment, 150 for 'supplies' ( must be for the starbucks) plus tuition 
3. must be okay with unfriendly staff drop your kid and leave. 
4.Must be able to figure out their plans they don't tell you crap till day of!

UPDATE: The school asked that I remove this post.....ugh I think not!!!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1123"><text>I've been taking route 57 - Courtney Park for the past 6 years and it's been a disaster. This route operates only every half an hour during rush hours and even that is with lots of problems. 

- sometime one bus doesn't show up AT ALL
- there is never any action taken to accommodate for the problems on the route or with the bus breaks down 
- the bus stops, either in terminal or even enroute have no shelter and waiting so long in cold winters is not fun!</text></sentence><sentence id="1124"><text>The water for the shower was not hot enough. The rooms are pretty old and our refrigerator was faulty. Not the best place to stay.</text></sentence><sentence id="1125"><text>The service throughout the night was inconsistent.  I asked how the shrimp was prepared.  The server said, "medium, we prepare all of our fish medium." Uncooked shrimp? No thanks.  We ordered two appetizers, a salad, steaks, and a side dish.  The oysters were placed on the table without explanation of the accompanying sauces.  The salad was good, tomatoes were fresh.  The lobster mashed potatoes had so much butter that it was pooling around the edges of the bowl.  One steak was overcooked, came out medium well instead of medium rare.  The server took it back and the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered to even cook both steaks again so we could eat together.  We felt it was handled appropriately and would easily have returned for future meals after this.  However, the steak never came out.  I asked the server after a long while to see if it may be ready.  She came back from the kitchen frazzled and said, "it will be out but I don't have a time to give you."  Then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat, set it down, did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left. It was very fatty and appeared to be NOT the cut of meat (filet) that I had ordered.  It was over cooked, again.  The server happened to walk over and said, "yes, I thought that it didn't look right."  I left without eating dinner.  She brought the check over and said, "I'm sure you guys don't want dessert, so I brought the check."  The manager never followed up to see if I had received the new steak.  The issues could've easily been solved had someone not dropped the ball and given up on following through.  They did credit the check for two steaks, but really that was not the issue.  Unfortunately, this restaurant was a big let down.</text></sentence><sentence id="1126"><text>Had the Giglio pasta tonight. It was AMAZING!

I went to the Craig location and was blown away by the quality of the poke.  I was so stoked when I learned that they have a South location. The customer service is superb and you can sample all the different poke. Personally I like the spicy ahi poke, salmon with special sauce. This is definite must try</text></sentence><sentence id="1128"><text>Recently I have been searching for a window cleaning service for my new business.  Out of all the companies I called, this was the only one who answered their phone.  As scheduled he came on time got the job done very quickly.

Highly recommended.</text></sentence><sentence id="1129"><text>Great service.... The food is phenomenal they have a restaurant connected to it so you get restaurant quality food.

More than pleasantly surprised with the quality and timeliness of the work.  But what compelled me to give a five star rating was the final bill.  When I picked up the car I was told I needed a new "pollen filter" and a new "air filter".  I was hoping it would be just an oil and oil filter change, but Carlos told me they needed to be changed.  I was shocked when he handed me the bill and it was at the estimated price. I asked about the filters, and he told me they were able to change them and honor the original estimated price.  This has never happened to me at a car service place ever.  Never ever.  I am a very satisfied customer.  They did the work at a fair price, and well under the dealer price.  Could not have asked for more.</text></sentence><sentence id="1133"><text>Second trip to Frank's, and it is always a very good experience.  Frank is beyond fair, the work is top-notch, and both times the car was delivered on-time as promised.

Everybody in the shop has a great attitude.</text></sentence><sentence id="1134"><text>I love the lemon pepper chicken with fried okra and feta spinach. Yum yum yum! I wish it were open more hours.</text></sentence><sentence id="1135"><text>Not delicious. I wanted it to be but it wasn't. Firecracker shrimp didn't have good flavor. Looked like some college guy's sad first attempt at stir fry. I'll never eat here again.</text></sentence><sentence id="1136"><text>This place is beyond amazing. My boyfriend took me here for the first time a month ago. By far the best tacos ever...</text></sentence><sentence id="1137"><text>Great place right on the Capitol Square. Very good food and good beer selection. Pretty good prices as well. Expect to pay anywhere from $8-$10 for a sandwich/burger with side. Didn't end up having the fried cheese curds like other people recommend but they did look delicious!

Only gripes for this place are that you can expect to wait a while for a table and they do not take reservations. Second, when it gets busy the service can be slightly spotty and it seemed to take a while to get our food.

It's such a great place though that's probably why it's so busy!</text></sentence><sentence id="1138"><text>Another great staple of Madison that is a must try. Food is very good and beer is of course good. You can get free popcorn for the table. Order food and drinks at the bar and they bring it out to you.

The outside seating area is awesome too in both summer and fall. A must try if you are going through Madison.</text></sentence><sentence id="1139"><text>Came here in the winter (January) and still had a lovely time! Walked around the outside areas where we were told the things to see included grasses and bark.....

Who doesn't love a conservatory in winter? Nice steamy walk through an area teeming with life! Great variety of plants and trees to see along with some birds (mostly quail). For some reason I'm a sucker for pitcher plants, for which there were a number for me to see around the conservatory. Would definitely like to come back in spring/summer.</text></sentence><sentence id="1140"><text>This is a fun place in Madison to come hang out especially on Fridays or weekends. Was pretty packed this past Friday when I went and at first was kind of too much craziness. Luckily we had reserved seats and people seemed to settle down after the first couple innings as lines for beer and food shortened considerably.

Love the beer that they have here. Lots of Great Dane brews and more common craft brews. Food is pretty good with burgers, brats, pulled pork, chicken, fries, slaw, potato salad all available.

Would recommend paying the $5 for the reserved seating in advance though the only drawback is that this is not like a picnic table so it is a bit hard to have a group there in reserved seats and all be comingling unless you are getting up a lot. Regardless, this is still a fun time and it shows by how packed it gets.</text></sentence><sentence id="1141"><text>It is pricey for the average golfer but if you are an avid one who appreciates good golf courses and experiences, this is a great choice. Played the Desert and Canyon courses which were both in very good shape. Cool layouts with some challenges including some tight holes. Overall though this is a very beautiful course on SE side of Camelback Mountain. 

Only criticism is that we got out early on the Desert course and played pretty quickly only to get stuck behind a whole bunch of groups at the turn going to the Canyon course. The ranger/time starter guys couldn't exactly explain why that happened.

Overall though this is a great course with nice amenities. Grass tees. GPS in cart. Would definitely come play again.</text></sentence><sentence id="1142"><text>Course was in great shape and is reasonably priced for a TPC course. This is a fun course to play but is very tight! Great location right at the Marriott in Scottsdale and is convenient to get to from most places.

The people were friendly except for one guy in the pro shop. Interestingly the 18th hole is the only one where there were some quality issues as the fairway and green were not in as good of shape as the rest of the course.

All in all though, I would definitely return.</text></sentence><sentence id="1143"><text>The only knock I have on this course is that it is a bit pricey (which is a common complain of mine). But overall this was a great course and a great experience.

We played in late December so there was a frost delay but once we got off it was sunny and not very cold. The group in front of us was playing a bit slow from the outset and by the third hole the ranger was on them to speed up (which they did).

Course is playable for many skill levels. My group played the tips and are above average golfers and we enjoyed our experience a lot. It was not an overly challenging course but still required skill. Very professionally run course with 3 separate nines (we played Ironhead and Acacia). 

Course was in good shape and greens rolled true. Only additional complaint would be that the restaurant was under construction and not open for another month or so and when we went to the only other shop which had food they were out of some different beers and other items (which they had on display and made it seem like they did have them available).

I would return.</text></sentence><sentence id="1144"><text>Not much to complain about here. Good food on the east side of Madison with a good beer and drinks menu. I had the bison burger which was fantastic and got the side of cucumber cilantro quinoa. People I was with had skirt steak (again delicious) with garlic mashed potatoes (you guessed it....delicious). 

Very nice wait staff and good homey kind of place. If I lived in Madison I would definitely come back to this place as a staple.</text></sentence><sentence id="1145"><text>This course is on the less expensive end of the scale for Scottsdale which still means fairly pricey (I believe it was around $80-$90 per person in prime season in end of March?). There is no driving range but we went to one of the courses nearby beforehand which wasn't very far away.

Overall though thought the course was pretty solid with a nice layout. Greens in good shape. Course had some challenges but also had an overall layout that seemed to keep the ball findable because everything sloped inward. Got out at 8:45 or so and played pretty quickly. Would definitely come back for more.</text></sentence><sentence id="1146"><text>Found this place on Yelp while I was on vacation in Scottsdale so figured we would try it out and it was wonderful!

The service was great and there wasn't really anyone else there when we went so Arturo stopped by and offered us some of the Habanero Tequila (apparently he makes it). WOW it was hot. Not really for me but very interesting and awfully cool of him to come out and offer us some.

Food was great! I had three different tacos (Calimarii, Blackened Fish, and Carnitas) and all were awesome!. Other people in my party got blackened fish entree, the carnitas entree, the carne asada entree. Everyone was happy!

Friendly people and great food. Pricing was very reasonable too. My tacos were $2.50/$2.99 each and most entrees were in the $6-$9.50 range.

Would definitely return!</text></sentence><sentence id="1147"><text>Cool distillery/bar east of Madison. Didn't really see a lot of the distillery but mainly there is a drinking room. They have a menu of different cocktails. Was there on a Saturday around 6 and it was fairly busy.

Pricing is pretty good - generally $6 per mixed drink. Try the Honey-Cap!</text></sentence><sentence id="1148"><text>Always hard to judge how strenuous a hike is from reading reviews cause you don't know people's fitness levels. This will definitely present a challenge for people that don't exercise much as the first part is fairly steep and continues for probably about 30-45 minutes. We took the trail up to Tom's Thumb and back which took at least 2 hours round trip. We started early like some recommended to take advantage of shade on the first part of the trail at that time of day and it was a great idea. 

The trail itself though is very nice aesthetically with great views and an interesting path. The trail to Tom's Thumb is pretty well marked. The view from Tom's Thumb is great and you marvel at seeing the trailhead parking lot off in the distance, seeing where you started from.</text></sentence><sentence id="1149"><text>Great Mexican place in downtown Madison just off State Street. This place strikes you as very authentic (perhaps it was something about the luchador fights on TV in the restaurant with the Spanish commentary).

Food was awesome. Had tostadas and gorditas which were both fantastic (chorizo, steak, pastor (pork) - can't go wrong!). You can buy individual tostadas or gorditas for $3.50/$3 each though there are lots more options. Also had this amazing drink that was like milk with cinnamon toast crunch flavoring. Definitely check that out.</text></sentence><sentence id="1150"><text>Been to the Dane County Farmer's Market more times than I can count over the years. What an awesome event every Saturday. Atmosphere is wonderful. The market extends around all 4 sides of the Capitol. 

Highlights of the market are the wonderful fresh food, trying all the awesome cheese samples (curds, fried cheese, aged cheese, etc.). Doesn't get much better than the fried cheese. Great pastries/bakery items too - hot and spicy cheese break, donuts, muffins, scones, etc. I've also bought vegetable plants from the market and they've seemed to turn out better than ones you buy from home depot or somewhere like that.

Truly an awesome place. Lots of people though and if you get there after 10 it is pretty crazy busy. More like a crawl around the Capitol.</text></sentence><sentence id="1151"><text>I'm always surprised at how hard it is to find good Pad Thai but this was always good. Service was usually good. I would do both sit down and carry out and had good experiences with both.

Mainly remember this place for the solid Pad Thai. Nice people. Cash only.</text></sentence><sentence id="1152"><text>Saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and had to come try the brioche french toast. We went on a week day and it wasn't very crowded. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food that I was with (people got omelet, the Wolfpack (hash browns with eggs and bacon in between more hash browns) though noone thought it was outstanding.

The brioche french toast I had came with caramelized bananas and pecans and I had to ask for more bananas because I literally was brought 3-4 small slices of banana on top of my french toast and the pecans were all bits and pieces. To their credit, they brought me out a lot more bananas and they were caramelized and in the caramel sauce.

I would definitely return.</text></sentence><sentence id="1153"><text>This place is nice but nothing outstanding. If you are looking for a place to go and get pampered this is not the place for you. The pool is nice and the hot tub is pretty large and awesome.  

The only restaurant on the premises is a small snack shop by the pool which has sandwiches and such. The rooms have kitchens which provide what you need if you want to make your own food while you are there. There is a breakfast provided from 8-8:45 two days a week which is nice but isn't out for long after the 8:45 end time. During that time you are presented different activities and excursion type stuff you can do in the area.

The concierge is definitely helpful as they recommended a good breakfast place (though there are others) and helped us get a tee time at a discounted rate at a nice course nearby.

Assuming you have a car, going to Sedona is a must and is a pretty drive up there. Also interesting if you are adventurous and are comfortable driving on unpaved roads in the mountains is driving the Apache Trail which goes out to Tonto National Forest and Roosevelt Lake.

I would likely go somewhere else if I went back to Scottsdale as I wasn't blown away by the place, but it depends what type of vacation you are looking for. The place was clean but the maid service didn't really do much.</text></sentence><sentence id="1154"><text>Oh! This place is soooooo gooooooooood. Brunch buffet is absolutely ridiculous - prime rib on Sunday, every kind of breakfast food you can imagine, for a little extra you get all you can drink mimosas, cinnamon rolls are awesome.

For dinner I was a huge fan of the cheddar burger (you get a ton of shredded cheddar on top) and the prosciutto pizza. Beer was great too.

Service is typical. Decent prices. Food is fricking awesome.</text></sentence><sentence id="1155"><text>This place rocks. Would come here very often if I still lived in Madison. Everything from the food, to the setup, to the d&#233;cor is awesome. Not been to many places where you go to find more seating upstairs and it basically feels like you just got home. There are tables and then a whole loft-style area with couches and comfy chairs where people can hang out. But in an authentic way, not the forced Starbucks kind of way.

The food is stellar. Got the chorizo skillet which was amazing. My part also indulged in blueberry and raspberry scones which were awesome (taking cues from the other recommendations). I enjoyed a nice hazelnut coffee and then got the free refill! Also loved how you can take jars of preservatives/jam to your table to which were also delicious.</text></sentence><sentence id="1156"><text>Went for the tour and drinking on a summer Saturday. Pretty nice little Saturday! Tour is $5 and they just take you through the warehouse and some of the brewing area. It isn't anything overly special. If you've been on other brewery tours before it is a pretty standard one.

Beer I great though. With the $5 tour you get a small tasting glass and three different tastings. They have the staples along with more seasonal and experimental type brews. Pretty reasonable prices too if you want beers/pitchers also (which you will). Pitchers are generally around $11.</text></sentence><sentence id="1157"><text>worst cup cakes ever - my husband and i tried the salted caramel and the peanut butter and chocolate and they were both very dry and heavy.

Professional flaretenders.  Sooshey and the guys throw up a mean cocktail with some sick tricks to go with it.

I agree with some of the other ratings I've read about the friendly staff, good machines, and comfortable environment. Only downfalls are that the WIFI doesn't always connect to my PC and that they don't do alterations w/ dry cleaning. I can def overlook those things, however. Oh, and I LOVE that the machines accept debit/credit cards: note that it'll automatically take about $15 dollars out though, then comp the difference afterwards.</text></sentence><sentence id="1168"><text>TR Lawing handled my business very professionally.

The club itself is very nice and the staff was great. We shared the pickle fries and spinach artichoke dip, which were both very good. We even got to witness someone literally spit their entire drink up from laughing so hard. Overall a great place to hang out and laugh your ass off</text></sentence><sentence id="1170"><text>Cheap prices but I'd rather pay full price for decent food.

Calamari was greas instead of crispy, served on a bed of tomato sauce rather than dipping sauce. 

Prime rib sliders tasted like the meat had spent the last week in the refrigerator before being served. 

Last was the tenderloin skewers , my wife ate them as I had lost my appetite...she said the best part was the sauteed spinach they were served on. Ya, they shoved a wooden skewer into 3 chunks of random shaped  over cooked salty meat.

Waitress was very nice and was sure to remind me how cheap the bill was, I guess so I would't stiff on the tip.

My beer was nice &amp; cold ...I should have stopped there.</text></sentence><sentence id="1171"><text>Excellent food, a wide variety of different pasta, seafood, steaks.  The etouffee was delicious with plenty of sauce to rice ratio.  The chicken alfredo was more than enough for a hungry 7 year old. The finale was the chocolate mouse cake!

Great date place with table cloths and cloth napkins and a chilled fork for your salad.</text></sentence><sentence id="1172"><text>Was very helpful.

I understand this is a pizza place but I paid over $10 for 5 burnt chicken fingers and 10 burnt fries. I LITERALLY counted 10 fries.

I had to take care of a busted iPhone 6plus screen and decided to just ditch the iPhone all together. I was totally prepared to turn the iPhone in and get the 80$ credit so I wouldn't have to deal with fixing it. Keith explained ALL of my options and I had a clear understanding of what I was getting. I switched from Verizon, WAS VERY IMPORTANT I KEEP MY NUMBER.. he transferred my  contacts(offered to transfer photos if needed), had the screen protector put on my phone. The best part is he did all of this in 20 MINUTES. 

Everyone at this store was extremely professional and friendly. Keith understood what I needed and I felt comfortable about making the switch from Verizon after 14 years!!! Nicholas and Robbi (sp?) were knowledgeable and professional as well.

Thanks again. I left the store feeling like I got exactly what I needed and was looking for.

 If you're looking for an EFFICIENT FAST professional you can trust, I would go to this location.</text></sentence><sentence id="1175"><text>This was honestly the best time I've ever had getting my photo taken!

My last passport photo was taken at a Black's, and was so bad that customs agents actually laughed every time they saw it.

In comparison, I actually look so much better in this photo than I do in real life! John (the owner) absolutely adores what he does. From the second I walked in, he had nothing but compliments for me. He gives you the option to choose from multiple poses, and then takes the best one and does some slight Photoshop magic to make it even better. He then prints it while you wait.

Cash only - all in, it cost $7.90 for 2 passport photos with the official stamp, and he threw in an additional one "for my mom". 

Overall, it took 10 minutes for the whole "experience", but it also never felt rushed. I'm tempted to go back to get other random photos taken, just because he made me feel so good about myself! Be sure to ask him about the time he was in a movie with Mark Wahlberg - he has the photos to prove it!</text></sentence><sentence id="1176"><text>The food was good and our bartender Rob made excellent drinks.

The ambiance and architecture of the restaurant is super hip. Looking forward to sitting on the patio too. Our server Joy was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and helped us pair our drinks with the food we ordered. We had some oysters, the Avocado salad, Salmon and the Radio Milano pasta dish and it all tasted delicious. Their cocktail list is really inventive and yummy! This is definitely going to be the new hot spot in Arcadia!!! Can't wait to go back and try more of the food and drinks!</text></sentence><sentence id="1183"><text>We have visited this place multiple times over the past few years and when I found out they had a private room for me and my guests I was so excited! At first they were very accommodating, they let us see the room and discuss how we were going to set it up for our party and went over the menu's with us. It came as a big surprise to me when we showed up and had to wait over an hour and a half for our first course to come out! Everything just went downhill from there. We complained to our server multiple times (we had 1 server for a party of 40) that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it. I had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside, fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner. Then when half of our guests left I realized they never sent out dessert and we had to ask for it! I was then told we should have requested dessert to come out, what kind of restaurant waits 45 minutes to bring dessert after a meal is finished?

My BIGGEST disappointment was how the catering manager, Michelle, handled everything after I sent her an email. I understand that she is the owner's wife but I've had teenagers talk to me nicer than she did. She was brash and offensive. Not only did she not take blame for anything she blamed our party for all of the issues. You can count on the fact that I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone and will have negative things to say when asked; which is unfortunate because I work downtown and a lot of people always ask me for recommendations. I sure hope the lack of customer service turns people off from dining here, you are better off going to Cheesecake Factory!</text></sentence><sentence id="1184"><text>We tried the Coronado Cafe last night, and it exceeded our expectations.

It was my first trip to Las Vegas and my boyfriend wanted to impress. By taking me here, he definitely did as well as enjoyed the food himself.

We were recommended to try the Chef's menu and also followed it with the wine pairings. We both enjoyed the Ahi tuna tartar, LOVED the lobster pot pie, which got the pie to innards content right (I like a little breadness with each bite), and both of us were in awe of the Kobe with sear foie on top. I don't know if they still do that, but both of us just melted a little inside with each bit. It's in our top 2 of steaks...and trust me, we eat a lot of steak. I don't even remember the dessert, that's how mind blowing the steak was. I'm sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at Michael Mina was nothing but excellent.

Service was impeccable, and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread. The wine pairings were done well, but I was happy I was staying in the Bellagio after dinner because that was a significant amount of alcohol in one sitting. The atmosphere was elegant without pretension or "over-styling." Probably the most comfortable restaurant I went to in Vegas. Most people were well dressed (i.e. slacks and dresses) but no need for anything over the top. I wore a little black dress and my boyfriend wore a nice sports coat with dark slacks. While we were probably the youngest ones there, the servers didn't treat us like we didn't belong there, which sometimes happens in upscale restaurants. Big plus for that.

I'd love to go back, but this time, I'd probably order something different just so I could try other things...but I'd get the Kobe again. For sure.

It's worth the pennies to go, and try the chef's menu!</text></sentence><sentence id="1187"><text>Carnevino is definitely a meat-lovers joy - but maybe a little over-priced for what you get.

My boyfriend is a carnivore and steak-addict, to the point where his friends recommended he come here.

We started with the Beef Tasting Menu, and while the crudo was well done, my issue was so many places seem to do a raw Kobe appetizer. Something a little more creative (with same meat!) would have been lovely. I will say I really loved the beef-cheek ravioli - I stole my boyfriends because I felt my portion needed to have more in it. Personally, the wet and dry aged beef were good and "beefy and meaty," but my preferences run towards melty and buttery type of steak. I preferred the dry aged to the wet...the wet aged just seemed a little bland in comparison. 

We veered off course a bit - my boyfriend wanted MORE meat and we ordered the dry-aged bone in Rib-Eye for 2. I didn't eat much as my boyfriend devoured it, but the meat was flavorful for sure...just not my style. Ending with the tasting menu desert, which I can't remember because it was so generic. I think creativity could have been a lot better.

Service was good and they helped us find wines to pair with our dinner well. Our server was so excited we wanted more steak - but maybe he just wanted the bigger tip resulting from the massive bill? The worst part of the meal was being seated in an area that looked out onto the casino/hotel walkway. I prefer people not staring at me or my meals when I eat. 

Lastly, the price. While the cuts of meat were good, I just don't feel the costs justified what was done in the meal. The creativity was lacking and maybe it's because it's such a meat-BASED restaurant...but I feel like it could have been more creative. 

If you liked dry-aged steak and big, bold Italian reds, this is the place for your. But I prefer my steak to melt like butter in my mouth and this isn't the place for it. I will tell you my boyfriend enjoyed it far more than I did. Otherwise, maybe try another, more diverse restaurant in the Palazzo/Venetian Restaurant row.</text></sentence><sentence id="1188"><text>Amazing steak and other food, but be prepared for a slight bit of wallet shock.

I made reservations at CUT back in May while visiting LV, but due to an unfortunate bout of illness (DO NOT EAT DUCK FRIED RICE FROM THE BELLAGIO POKER ROOM)  that required hospitalization, I was forced to give my reservations to my friends. The next day, visiting me in the hospital, they raved about the quality of the steaks, being from overseas. I knew that next time I was in Las Vegas, I would need to go.

What luck that several weeks later my boyfriend did extremely well in a WSOP event, and we returned to Las Vegas and made another reservation at CUT for mid June.

We were seated a booth with a leather tables and service was quick and prompt. We knew we wanted steak, but my boyfriend and I have very different tastes in wine, so the sommelier came over to help us with the (very) awkward iPad wine list. She helped us pick just the right wine that met our desires. 

After ordering our wine, we got down to business. For appetizers, we had the Kobe sashimi and the Roasted Beets with goat cheese. They actually balanced quite nicely, as we knew we had a lot of meat ahead of us. 

For our main courses, I chose the American Wagyu filet, normally 6 oz, and added an extra 2 oz for extra. I love Kobe filet for it's melting butter like quality, and this cut was no exception. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and it was the quality and taste I would expect for a $130 steak. My boyfriend chose the New York Sirloin tasting that consisted of the dry aged American sirloin, American Wagyu, and NZ Wagyu. He ordered it rare and it came slightly over rare (which is acceptable, because these cuts were THICK) and they were epic. Just meaty and buttery at the same time. My steak-loving boyfriend was in heaven. 

For sides, we had the mac &amp; cheese, and spring peas with bacon. To be honest, we didn't eat much of those as we focused primarily on the steak, but both were good - also rich and bacony! 

After some excessive meat consumption, I saw a souffle float by to another table. I had to dig deep down, but I never regretted the chocolate souffle. It was rich but airy at the same time. I didn't even look at the other desserts, but it was one of the best I've had. The small little cookies and tarts were a nice little treat we had wrapped up to-go that went nicely with our coffee for breakfast the next morning.

The service was extremely attentive and water refills/bread requests came quickly and discretely. (Yes, the bread was that good too). My one disappointment is the overall atmosphere. The overly slick design and mirrors everywhere made me feel like I was in an HGTV show instead of a restaurant.  When I think steakhouse, I think a little more comfortable and a little less "sleek." That said, I also deplored the amount of  people taking pictures...man people, don't use flash in a restaurant, I like to eat my food without blinding. If you're so consumed by where you are, please avoid me at all costs.

Overall, I recommend CUT if you have money to splurge but you'll be sure to enjoy your meal.</text></sentence><sentence id="1189"><text>Great hotel with fabulous services and restaurant - just what Phoenix needs!

We stayed here for a few days after trying to find a place to stay in Phoenix that WASN'T a chain or a massive resort for a decent price and were very pleased to find the Clarendon Hotel.

The room we stayed in was CLEAN, large and comfortable, and the bed was fantastic. The Keurig in the room was a great plus along with the provided robes. My only complaint about the room was the tiiiiiiny bathroom. However, the great pool and hot-tub in the main courtyard really made the stay even better and we enjoyed chatting with other guests while enjoying a cocktail or beer from Gallo Blanco (which incidentally, is also fantastic!).

My biggest issue was the "resort fee." I really deplore the addition of the resort fee tacked on after you check in - PLEASE just include this in the regular price of a room when you check in...but also, this isn't reaaaaaaally a resort, so why such an outrageous "resort fee?" Still, fee and all, the Clarendon Hotel is worth it, and provided us with a great place to stay in Phoenix.</text></sentence><sentence id="1190"><text>This was the place I was most looking forward to eating at in Vegas. I'm sad to say I was disappointed. 

The food was amazing, but the atomosphere and service were way below the the prices they charge. It felt like a cheap club with fantastic food. Very disconnected. Our server was condecending. She seemed annoyed we didn't order "enough" (she'd recommended 2-3 cold dishes, 2-3 hot dishes, and 2 sushi rolls) but that was our choice. We'd had a late lunch. 

If you just want good food, I'd recommend saving your money and going elsewhere. If you're a 20 or 30-something and want a party atmosphere and don't care about the bill, this could be fun for you.</text></sentence><sentence id="1191"><text>I had high hopes for Craftsteak, and it definitely delivered. Fantastic food in a classy yet unpretentious environment, and amazing service. 

Some notes: 
-We ordered the cheaper steaks on the menu, and they were AMAZING. Melt in your mouth. Hard to imagine how good the Waygu and other pricey ones would be. But don't feel like you'll be shortchanged by ordering the cheaper ones. 
-Don't skip salads. The fava bean salad was the best thing I ate. Who knew a salad could be so good. 
-Sit at the bar before dinner if you have time. Our reservation was running a bit late, so we had a drink. The bartenders make the most delicious, strong drinks. 

If you love steak and want a classy dinner in Vegas, go here! You won't be disappointed.</text></sentence><sentence id="1192"><text>Ate at China Poblano when I was in Vegas last week and hadn't looked at any Yelp reviews prior. I'm surprised to find it only has 3 stars on here. I thought it was AMAZING. Most importanly, it was priced appropriately, unlike so many places in Vegas.

Some notes:

-The atmosphere was fun (decor is amazing!)
-Service was great
-Food was creative and delicious
-A few dishes were a miss (a noodle soup with the word "ugly" in the name), but most were spot on. 
-Mexican food was slightly better than the Chinese, but that makes sense given Jose's backgound.

The place is nice and quiet. Menu has a good variety of options from boba to coffee to smoothies. 

We ordered two drinks which was the Classic Taiwanese Milk Tea and the Signature Thai Tea. Milk tea was alright, it wasn't as sweet nor milky as most boba places. Thai tea was just like your regular Thai tea that you get at restaurants. And the boba was unusually smaller than your regular boba which was surprising coming from a boba place.

What was really disappointing was the amount of ice that was in the drink! My boyfriend and I took two sips of the milk tea to try the flavor and noticed that the cup was pretty much ice! The 12oz cup (not even the bottle) was filled with 2/3 ice &amp; 1/3 tea. I know it's being nit picky but I feel like I got gypped paying $4.50. Mind you, they were out of their cool bottles which comes standard with their drinks and still payed for the same price for a plain regular plastic cup - no name or anything. 

Overall, I think Jozo is jumping in with the trend of hipster branding but is lacking quality on the flavor.

The physical therapists are helpful, but compared to other places, are not attentive enough because they are often seeing many patients at once. I thought the service was very good until I visited other physical therapists that give much more one-on-one time and assess your progress much more closely.

Example: I was often left to do my stretches with the therapists mostly coming back to give me something else to do. Besides asking how I felt from time to time, they did not reassess my abilities to walk or stretch as other therapists have. How do they know what is working if they don't assess your progress?</text></sentence><sentence id="1199"><text>I have both eaten in and taken out with a positive experience. 

From walking by, it doesn't look like the greatest place, but they have an interesting menu with different asian/asian fusion dishes so there's a little bit for everyone from the exotic to the simple.

The Malaysian Sate, which I had with beef, was delicious and came in a more than adequately sized portion. The Pad Thai is also a delicious meal. All of the appetizers and other dishes I tried were more than satisfactory. 

For a student on a budget, this place is both delicious and relatively inexpensive.

I chose the salad bar option, which was poorly stocked. The selection did not look all that appetizing.

When ordering burgers, the first selections that we made were not available so I settled on a Bison Burger. It was not much to speak of from the bun to the toppings or even the meat itself. It wasn't memorable or particularly tasty. The french fries I tried seemed overdone and like they had been sitting out.

Frankly. I would not recommend this place. My meal left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. The food was not that good and the service also left something to be desired. The restaurant was a little dark, uncomfortable booths, and didn't have a nice atmosphere....

Served tapas style, the food is conducive to sharing and ordering lots of little things. We tried for all ranges of the menu and thought the dishes had interesting flavor profiles, were prepared well, and tasted great.

The seviche section allows you to choose a fish and a style of preparation -- they are delicious! The filet mignon was also a wonderful cut of meat.

Mojitos are a bit pricey at $9 a drink for the small glasses they are in, but are delicious all the same.</text></sentence><sentence id="1202"><text>Fun atmosphere. Good food. Big beers.

I would suggest the appetizer sampler (the works). As many below me will agree, the sauerkraut balls are delicious. The bier cheese &amp; pretzels were good too.

I had the Bayerischer Schweinsbraten (pork with sauerkraut and a potato dumpling). It was different than I expected as I'm not too familiar with German food, but still pretty good. The pork was cooked well and had a good sauce. I wish I had substituted mashed potatoes instead of the dumpling.</text></sentence><sentence id="1203"><text>A big menu selection with even bigger size portions (so big I took half of my sandwich home).

The best thing I have tried here was the Chicken Scaloppini. The chicken is covered in melted cheese and has a great lemon sauce. I would highly, highly recommend this dish.

Although I did not try the salad, it looked great -- a ton of options, friendly staff to help you with your selections. Once you pick everything, they chop it and give you dressing. The salad was what I thought to be a big portion, much bigger than Panera and customized to what you want.

This is a great concept. I'm sure the place will do well. I'm told at lunch the line is already out the door and its not even the school year yet...

Its also nice how they have garage style doors at the front to keep a nice breeze coming through and leave the place feeling more open.</text></sentence><sentence id="1213"><text>Great subs, bottom line.

The food took a long time to come out. I had the pulled pork tacos and was very disappointed. They were SO greasy and didn't have a ton of flavor. I got the "bottom of the barrel" fries, which did not impress either.

I wanted to like this place, but would not recommend it based on my experience.</text></sentence><sentence id="1219"><text>I love these hot sandwiches. It is a big rtion that I can rarely finish in one sitting. If you eat in, you also get fries for free.

The service is pretty quick, although they do get quite busy at lunch time. The sandwiches come out hot and to order. I usually get the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak with L,T,M,O and always enjoy it. They also offer adding an egg, which can be yummy.

Highly recommend for a delicious hot sandwich at lunch or dinner.

Negatives:
- The restaurant itself looks kinda run-down from the furniture, to the floors, to the poor lighting. Although they seem to be going for an "old" look, it could really use a facelift.

- They only take CASH. They have a ATM-like machine to get cash, but it will charge you for the transaction.

- Wish they were open late!</text></sentence><sentence id="1220"><text>Love this place! Especially our waitress! Ask for LuAnna every time! She always makes sure everything is perfect! Even special requests for our kids! Great food, great family atmosphere, and great service!</text></sentence><sentence id="1221"><text>My goodness me! It's a regular "Dump on Los Sombreros Festival" here in Yelpland. Hey, people -- it's a perfectly fine Mexican restaurant. Well, maybe it's not perfect, but my meals here over the past five years have always been good, and I consider Los Sombreros a great place to take out-of-town guests. If I were to grade it on a pretentiousness scale, it actually rates better and is more inviting than Barrio Cafe. So give the place a break -- try the guacamole, the chicken mole, the lamb adobo, any of the skirt steak entrees and any of the seafood dishes.</text></sentence><sentence id="1222"><text>I am recommending this place on behalf of a relative, who was looking for an unusual flower arrangement for a special occasion and walked away with exactly what he wanted. Glad to know this little place exists in my neighborhood.</text></sentence><sentence id="1223"><text>My husband and I dined here twice within one week to seek solace after spending a lot of time in the Expo store down the way, where we were setting the wheels in motion for a huge kitchen remodel. Happy to report that our enchiladas and tacos provided sufficient comfort. The sauces are especially distinctive and good. There will be one more visit to Expo, after which I'm sure I'll head in the same direction -- and add a double margarita to my order.</text></sentence><sentence id="1224"><text>Giving four stars to China Chili doesn't necessarily mean I think the place is fantastic -- but the spicy garlic eggplant is fantastic, and I'm still pondering its fantasticness hours later. My husband and I also enjoyed the rest of our meal -- yiu-shan chicken and one of the house specialties, black pepper prawns and scallops. Yes, I concur with other reviewers that some of the dishes are not gonna be fantastic. Still, I look upon the place as reliable, clean, moderately priced and efficient. I don't need P.F. Chang's.</text></sentence><sentence id="1225"><text>Maybe the four stars is too generous after just one visit, but there's something about this place that's very comforting. Maybe it's the community seating, or the simple white bowls your veggies come in, or maybe it's the simple fact that you're eating your veggies and enjoying them too. I tried a yummy coconut curry with crispy tofu and appreciated that it was just the right portion for the price. I'm gonna try a vegan tsoynami with vegan tsoft tserve "ice cream" (spelling is correct) next time I go.</text></sentence><sentence id="1226"><text>Through unusual circumstances, I ate at three Thai restaurants within 24 hours the other day -- Bejarong Thai in Mesa for dinner, Thai Lahna for lunch the next day, and Malee's Thai Bistro for dinner that evening. And the winner is ... good ol' dependable Thai Lahna. I realize, though, that I am in a bit of a rut as to what I order there and need to branch out to some of their seafood and vegetarian entrees before I can call myself a Thai food aficionado. Also, my Far Eastern journey led to the pleasant discovery of Bejarong, which comes in second. Malee's -- I appreciate your twists on Thai food, but my half-plate entree was not worth the $9 I paid for it.</text></sentence><sentence id="1227"><text>It was back in the '80s when Town and Country Shopping Center was a hoppin' place on weekend nights because of its great selection of trendy restaurants. Maybe those heydays are gone, but as someone from the neighborhood, I am glad to see a few small "boutique" restaurants going in, and Cyprus Pita Grill might well start drawing more crowds. The food is carefully prepared and presented, the atmosphere is cute faux Greek, and the service is pleasant. The lamb on my gyro plate was tender and scrumptious and I regret I didn't order any appetizers. A neighboring table was ordering all appetizers instead of entrees and they looked wonderful. Three of us sated ourselves for a mere $45 and resolved to stop by more often.</text></sentence><sentence id="1228"><text>El Molino makes the chimichanga by which I rate all other chimichangas -- if another restaurant doesn't give it  just the right crispiness, with just the right accompaniments of cheese, guacamole and sour cream, then it just doesn't cut it. By the way, after almost 30 years in Phoenix I've eaten more chimichangas than I care to admit. Get El Molino's chicken or machaca chimi, which is often a nightly special for under $8, and you will be in sinus-clearing chimi heaven.</text></sentence><sentence id="1229"><text>Previous reviews make a lot of good points, but I disagree that the food is bland. Try the house specialties, the soups and the spring rolls. I had not been in for a few years and was pleasantly surprised on my visit last night as to how busy it was. This is good value and quality for an area of central Phoenix where good restaurants are scarce. And don't dis the desserts -- they're terrific.</text></sentence><sentence id="1230"><text>Must echo Brian O. about the lack of circulation in the booth area. Not good when the temp is 113 degrees, no matter how many times the server refills your water. By the way, our service was good and efficient, and we liked the guacamole prepared tableside. Also, we liked the many vegetarian options and the way the shrimp tacos were prepared. I hardly ever venture out to Glendale, but at least now I know of a decent Mexican restaurant there.</text></sentence><sentence id="1231"><text>I feel like part of the in-crowd whenever I dine at Barrio Cafe. This is good and bad: good, because I realize, as hordes of other people do, that this is some of the most innovative Mexican food in town; bad, because tonight I realized the in-crowd often is, in its lust for a good meal, downright rude. One set of patrons muscled its way to the front of the line as the restaurant geared up for its 5 p.m. Saturday opening. I mean, really, just get in line. Then, once we were dining, we noticed another set of patrons coming in the back door and just seating themselves at an empty table. The waitperson, to her credit, remained polite toward them. Sigh, I'm trying a week night next time ...</text></sentence><sentence id="1232"><text>I would agree that the food and pastries here are above average, but when I walk into a small, crowded, noisy place and don't know where to go for a simple beverage and no employee seems to notice my perplexity or to care, I come away feeling the place is pretentious, snobby, confusing and out of my league. Which is too bad, because it's right in my neighborhood. I sense that if you're a regular here, then probably you feel welcome and the employees chat you up all time. But not all of us can afford to be regulars here. This is at least the third time that La Grande Orange's uppity ambience has annoyed me, so I don't feel guilty about the poor review.</text></sentence><sentence id="1233"><text>This is better than average mall food, and I love the cookies and muffins. There oughta be a yellow caution tape around the establishment, though, because its ultra-centralized location forces way too many cream cheese brownie breaks and those clothes I'm trying on are not gonna fit me after all. I do have to wonder if the portions for salads and sandwiches are getting smaller. A customer next to me griped about it to the cashier, and lo and behold, my tasty pasta salad was a little on the chintzy side.</text></sentence><sentence id="1234"><text>Beware the ladies of Teavana! I say this good-naturedly, but also as a warning. Let me say first that as a tea freak I love that this place exists, and now I can go to either the Biltmore or Scottsdale Fashion Square location. But here's what happened to me, and I repeat it here as a warning: I walked by the store with no intention of going in. Thirsty, I sampled a tea by the door, then another tea. Then I thought, what the heck -- I walked a few feet into the store and sampled another tea. That's when a lady of Teavana snagged me, chatting quite knowledgeably about the tea I was tasting and inviting me, like a Siren, to get a whiff from a tea canister at the counter. Expertly, she fanned the lid of the canister over the leaves so that I could get the full effect. Oh my, that orange-pomegranate-whatever smelled good. Must I take some home? Oh yes, I must. That lovely 8-ounce canister of herbal tea will be $36, please. Yikes!</text></sentence><sentence id="1235"><text>I'm no seafood aficionado, but this place seemed pretty good to me, and I hope it sticks around because fresh seafood like this (and at these prices) is fairly unusual here in the desert. Our table tried the fish and chips, swordfish, seafood kebab and catfish -- and all were satisfied. As noted in other reviews, the staff is jovial and the atmosphere is pleasant. Whew -- saves me a trip to Boston!</text></sentence><sentence id="1236"><text>Seems like the menu has been overhauled since I last dined here a couple of years ago. But NBD. We skipped the appetizers, knowing that our entrees would be plenty filling. The tasty appetizer selection is worth considering, though, if you're at Flo's with a fairly big party. We liked all of our dishes -- the spicy bean curd, the shrimp and pan-fried noodles and the chicken vindaloo, with the latter being maybe the weakest of the bunch. With it being early and uncrowded on a hot and humid evening, the wait staff was friendly and very attentive. Try out this location before the snowbirds return.</text></sentence><sentence id="1237"><text>I'm trying to decide -- when it comes to pizza, am I a crust person or a topping person? If I am the latter, then I would say that the toppings we tried on three different pizzas were all good but could have been more plentiful. We especially liked the artichoke and olive pizza. Whatever exotic cheeses the chefs put on the pizzas are terrific but are just dotted on. I left the restaurant last night feeling crusty, which is to say I love the wood-fired, slightly burned, soft-on-the-inside crust. So much so that I almost finished off the crust left on my carb-watching daughter's plate. We'll see where things fall in the great crust/topping dilemma next time I visit.</text></sentence><sentence id="1238"><text>Lovely decor, good location, celebrity tie-in ... and food that left me wishing I had ordered something different. Out of our party of four, two of us ordered mediocre dishes -- the vegetarian chile relleno and the chicken mole casserole. But the two other dishes were fine -- spinach and mango salad and chicken enchiladas suiza. The chunky salsa was also quite good, especially for those of us who've deprived ourselves of tomatoes recently. Let this be a lesson to you (and me): read reviews on Yelp for recommendations on a new restaurant's best dishes before you go. Also, a note to our server: when a customer says his dish is just OK, then DOH! -- follow up by asking how it could be better. This is especially necessary at a new place.</text></sentence><sentence id="1239"><text>When we found out we had to spend the night in Las Vegas because of a cancelled flight to Europe, we surely hadn't foreseen a night at the Tropicana. That old place? But it turned out fine, and I'm glad we were there AFTER the remodel, from the sounds of the BEFORE. We walked through the Excalibur and, boy, does that place need to be brought out of the Middle Ages. As for the Trop, I'd like to put in a good word for the buffet at Cafe Nikki. It was simple and almost elegant and not what we expected from a buffet on the Strip. The cafe has a beach theme, which keeps things light and modern. Everything we tried tasted good, or good enough, and the desserts were crazy good. I appreciated that the chefs were hovering behind the buffet table every time I went up -- it showed me they cared.</text></sentence><sentence id="1240"><text>Have you ever had one of those experiences where you saunter out of a restaurant after your first visit there and you think, "Gee, not bad ... I'll be back," and then the next day you mention the restaurant to friends and they shoot you down. Not such a great place after all, they convince you. Well, in hindsight I see that my friend was right about the food here being on the bland side. Yes, it does seem to be prepared with your arteries in mind. But what is Indian food without creamy richness and sweat-inducing spice? I give Bombay Spice kudos for the innovative plating and for allowing you to order two entrees for the price of one. The happy hour is a terrific idea, and I might be back just for the $4 appetizers and wine.</text></sentence><sentence id="1241"><text>I get the feeling that little ol' Chop and Wok -- with its bar area, drink menu and kitschy tropical/beach bum decor -- is gearing up to be a twentysomethings hangout at night, and that's just fine. But I'll keep going for the quieter hours and the lunch specials, when the traditional Chinese chicken and vegetable dishes are all I need. Two tips: 
Try the crab puffs, which have been a Chop and Wok specialty for years. And park in the back instead of trying to maneuver in and out of a space from the busy intersection of Scottsdale and Shea.</text></sentence><sentence id="1242"><text>Ordered a Mediterranean salad. Expected green leafy lettuce. Received iceberg. Dressing was very salty. Very under-whelmed. The place was clean. And the gentlemen taking the orders was very nice</text></sentence><sentence id="1243"><text>This musical isn't going to win any Tony awards, but if you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies you'll enjoy it BUT only if you get the splatter zone. 

Like the movies the musical is packed full of campy humor and gore which is exactly why you love the movies. The song's lyrics are at most times over powered by the music, but I would have to say my favorite one was "WTF."

This reminded me of Community Theater with a few surprisingly good singers, terrible props and uncomfortable seats. I found it really funny that you could all ready see the tears and faded blood stains from past performances on their clothes from the very start. 

My group did the splatter zone and we LOVED it. They get you from all sides, but mostly it came from the back right. With the spaltter zone you get VIP seating, 2 for 1 bar drinks and a white Evil Dead t-shirt.

The odd thing about the "blood" was it was warm. I never did get use to that.

If you've seen all 3 movies, you will have fun. However, it does take a moment to get into. 

Here are a few things to think about:
-Don't go if you think this is going to be scary. It's not.
-Don't go if you are offended by swearing. They do it A LOT.
-Don't go if you hate campy movies with cult followings.
-Don't go if you never seen any of the Evil Dead movies.
-Don't go if you hate musicals.
-Don't go if you don't want to get "pinkish water" coloring on your clothes. It can get on you EVEN IF you aren't in the spatter zone. Mainly the first and second row behind the VIP area.
-Don't go because someone talked you into it. You won't like it. We saw a few couples/groups not come back after the second act because someone was whining they wanted to go.

DO GO-
-If you love the Evil Dead movies.
-If you have an open mind.
-If you are willing to "gamble" $40-$70 dollars on something you may not like.
-If you quoting the popular movie lines with the actors. The crowd was shouting these lines. It was a great vibe.

***The key is to expect the worst. That's what I did and I had fun.***</text></sentence><sentence id="1244"><text>One of my favorite restaurants hamds down. The martinis are amazing (jolly rancher), the salads and antipesto are so tasty. I always love the cozy feeling in tge winter and the hot patio with ferry lights in the summer. Great staff and amazing location.</text></sentence><sentence id="1245"><text>The food was pretty good.  Great atmosphere and crowd. But the waitress with the dark brown hair was rude and our food waited for her on the counter for 20minutes before givibg it to us so it was very cold. Her attitude was negative.  She rushed out orders and the orange juice is gross.</text></sentence><sentence id="1246"><text>Decent haircut, not so good shave. 

Classic barber chairs at big mirrors in gold painted wooden frames sitting on what look like antique-shop dressers (but they all match so probably not) plus photos of James Dean, The Rat Pack, and Laurel &amp; Hardy (!) and classic rock on the radio. Nice enough surroundings.

Had trouble communicating with my barber, whose English was limited. Simple questions were met with blank looks. We managed, but not without difficulty. The haircut was fine, not that I needed anything out of the ordinary. Oddly, the shampoo followed the cut, so he was working with somewhat dirty hair.

The hot towel shave was a real disappointment. First, the chairs do not recline at all, so there is no sense of relaxation. You either sit up straight and strain your neck to bend your head back, or slide forward in the chair and strain your back. The hot towel is perfunctory. The shave was unpleasant and sometimes painful, and my barber left three nicks on my neck. The cucumber gel afterward was a welcome finish.</text></sentence><sentence id="1247"><text>Let me get the one big negative out of the way: nowhere in the place are prices shown. Not anywhere. Not on the menu board, not on the counter or the display case or on any kind of sign. Sure, people who own homes in Baby Point can ignore such trivialities, but not the rest of us. More transparency, please!

Otherwise, we love this spot. Bright, airy, and mostly comfortable (except for those metal stools), with exceptional coffee, fascinating and unusual beverages (I tried the tumeric latte most recently) and a great philosophy about environmental respect and quality product.

Location is a bit out of the way. But while not especially convenient for us, we go anyway. The video screen with updated bus information is a great idea--riders can grab a coffee without worrying about missing their ride. Wifi seems good, music is listenable, and faces are friendly.

We are looking forward to future visits. Just let us know the prices, okay?</text></sentence><sentence id="1248"><text>They rarely answer their phone. In fact, most times you cannot even leave a voicemail. They responded to emails most of the time but we had to ask every question three times before their responses actually answered anything.

No notice of cancellation, no apology afterwards.</text></sentence><sentence id="1249"><text>The good: sparkling bathroom and some (but far from all) excellent cleaning elsewhere.
The not-so-good: Despite my emphasis on dusting, the tops of picture frames and other obvious surfaces were untouched. Despite my asking for a protective cover over the bed while dusting the ceiling fan above, they dusted right over the bedding. Other specific requests, which I wrote down for them, were forgotten or ignored. Even though a total time for cleaning was arranged, they managed the time badly, taking over an hour on one small room (wasting time on blinds and making the bed). I approved an extra hour but they went beyond that, too, without my approval--and of course charged me for it. Finally, sharing these and other concerns with the company resulted in "Thanks for your thoughts." No adjustment, apology or explanation.</text></sentence><sentence id="1250"><text>Just visited this candy store. Excellent selection and very sweet employees.

I won't go back.</text></sentence><sentence id="1252"><text>This is some of the better sushi in Toronto, but that's unfortunately not saying much.  I had take-out from Japango this evening, ordering only specials: yellowtail, uni, and horse mackerel.  The yellowtail was good, the uni excellent, but the horse mackerel was dried out and gave off the smell of too-old fish (and yes, I know that mackerel is an oily "fishy" fish even when fresh).  The ohitashi side dish featured spinach which hadn't been washed - plenty of crunchy dirt/sand in there.   I'll wait 'til I go to Vancouver, NYC, Seattle, or Chicago to have sushi again.</text></sentence><sentence id="1253"><text>I rarely get sick and, when I do, I always get better rather quickly so me going to StatClinix on Tuesday, July 7, was a big deal. I had been having trouble swallowing due to a major sore throat. I kept getting the cold sweats and could not sleep at night due to a cough and would gasp for air. After 2 hours at the Clinic, Dr. Greg Reser said nothing was wrong and to keep taking over-the-counter meds. I told him nothing had been working and that I was headed out of town soon so wanted to treat this before it turned into anything big. To that he said "come back in 3 days if you aren't better." I mentioned to him in 3 days I would be gone for 3 weeks, which he chose to blatantly ignore. So here we are 2 days later and I now have white spots on my tonsils - a major sign of strep which is common in my family. I just got off the phone with the Clinic and they said there is a different doctor I could go see today. I asked how much that would cost and they could not answer. Why would I return to a place that appears to be scamming people for their money? It shouldn't be this hard to receive meds that are desperately needed. If you are feeling ill, I beg you to go elsewhere rather than waste your money here.</text></sentence><sentence id="1254"><text>It's a decent airport.

I did my research with a good number of home inspectors and it was just obvious when calling them they give you the marketing pitch trying to appease you. When I called Bill he was straight up, and the real deal.

I am a buyer who was looking for a new home to live in. I had some unfortunate circumstances arise on my home inspections and Bill went above and beyond in his service to accommodate my situations because he really does care. 

His inspections are thorough and accurate. He finds everything that can be a problem with the house. Trust me I did more than one inspection with him. It's pretty crazy if you join him in the inspection to see how good he is. 

I thank Bill for the professionalism and quality of service that he has provided me. I will definitely recommend him to everyone and use him again if I need to do a home inspection. Really I rarely do reviews, just this morning my dentist office asked me to do a quick review on their computer and I was like nah. The lady got mad! Bill was so excellent that it made me want to review him here.</text></sentence><sentence id="1259"><text>Extremely overpriced for the amount of food you get. I used to go here all the time. The food was delicious. 

What changed was the portion of food. Most places increase prices when they need to. Not this place. No, what they did here is a disgusting disservice to the customer. They instead lessened the portion of the food by more than twice it was. It's less than the kids portion compared to some places. Yes! So now if you want the similar portion that you had before, then you have to pay for it twice. I think it would still be less than what one portion was though. Which makes this restaurant now grossly overpriced. 

For example, the last time I went here I had a combo plate that was the beef and chicken teriyaki with spam. I asked for no beef and replace with more spam. This is what I usually used to get. So you know what they gave me? 2 tiny pieces of spam! The chicken portion was also minuscule. And a tiny scoop of rice too, not even a whole scoop. 

I eat at many places in Vegas and around the country as I travel all the time. I mostly use yelp to give great reviews for amazing places that need more attention from customers. This place though, I logged in for the first time in a long time to give this one star review. It is that bad compared to what they used to be. It is way more expensive than every Manhattan non-waiter place I have been to, along with Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Miami, Toronto, etc. 

Guys, if this portion issue has changed please let me know. I will then try it again and see for myself and update my review accordingly. I used to love this place, but now it just still gets me mad when I think about what I paid for and then got.

UPDATE: May 2017
I want back again to see if they changed anything. I went back again to see if it was a fluke. It looks like they did raise the portions. Not as big as it used to be but this is much better then before where I gave a one star review. Food was still delicious!</text></sentence><sentence id="1260"><text>Great Lao/Thai food.

I have been going here for a while and it is delicious every time. I mainly eat the chicken cutlet or the curry udon. I went to Japan a few months ago and had curry several times while there, specifically Tokyo. Like around Shinjuku and Akihabara. I have eaten here before going to Japan and it was awesome but now that I have been to Japan I can say that it is authentic. It wasn't too far from how delicious the curry was in Japan. The owner is a cool guy too. I think I remember him saying he is from Akihabara.

Here in Vegas you probably won't find a Japanese curry as good as here, so take advantage!</text></sentence><sentence id="1264"><text>Best Chinese food in this side of town.

Armed with a book of information from the major (A/C units) to the minor (cracked switch plates, bad doorbell) provided by Tim, I was able to negotiate a better price on my house, AND (more importantly) to know exactly what I was getting into. We've been here for over 2 years now, and I can honestly say that I probably would not have made the leap had I not been armed with the confidence that Tim's inspection and report provided me.

The Chirashi bowl was well presented and filling. Fish was bold colored and fresh tasting! The clam hot pot was more than enough food for one person with plenty of clams. The meatball and chicken skewers were crispy and tender. The pork was very good as well, but a little tougher than the chicken and meatballs. 

Warm and comfortable ambience, attentive and pleasant service, and very good food. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes!</text></sentence><sentence id="1279"><text>I've gotten my haircut by Fatima for as long as I can remember. What's she's done with the salon has transformed the place into a relaxed yet professional atmosphere. She always makes sure you get exactly what you want and you leave looking beautiful and confident! She has years of experience doing both men and women's hair - I brought my boyfriend in and he loved his haircut also! Her prices are incredibly reasonable and she offers great deals on styling products. I've recommended her to my friends and family and no one has left disappointed!</text></sentence><sentence id="1280"><text>Ive been going here for a while (regularly), but lately I haven't seen the owner and it seems like theyve endlessly been rotating deadbeat employees through there. They're screwing up a ton of orders, and they oftentimes dont know the specials or how to run the register....not to mention theyre unprofessional. This place is going downhill QUICK and it's a shame.</text></sentence><sentence id="1281"><text>Is it just me, or does the staff at Trax Farms have a terrible attitude? Dont get me wrong, its not EVERYONE there....but in general, everyone just seems so miserable. In my experience, the staff usually reflects the attitude of management/ownership....so that cant be a good sign. Ive been going there since I was a toddler,  Ive been there more recently because we moved into the area. Im so disappointed. Not only is it expensive (which I was willing to deal with), but now I have to deal with a snooty staff that seems annoyed by every interaction or order. Maybe its because Trax is now out of the farming/customer service business and more into the Gas/Oil business? Oh well. Simmons and Bebout are right up the road and theyre definitely more welcoming.</text></sentence><sentence id="1282"><text>My wife recently took our puppy to Brush Run animal clinic and the Vet there told my wife to feed our puppy Milo "any of the dog foods in the grocery store...the natural foods out there are just a scam" Uhhh really?? Milo just went in for vaccinations and they gave him rabies, dap, and lepto all at once...then sent her on her way. No warnings, No "what to look for"...just collect their $$ and send you on your way. After observing Milo being lethargic and reading about what may becausing the discharge from his eyes (formaldehyde,mercury in the 5-8 vaccines that he received at once), Ive decided to research other Vets in the area and take our puppy elsewhere.</text></sentence><sentence id="1283"><text>Yep, it was pretty good. The dumplings were by far the best I've ever had. They also take credit/debit as well as cash, which was really convenient. Right in the heart of Chinatown. We got a plate of pork dumplings each, and were pretty pleased with our last minute dinner decision. Would recommend to dumpling snobs.</text></sentence><sentence id="1284"><text>Great ambience, great poutine. Couldn't have asked for more. Nice find in a fun area!</text></sentence><sentence id="1285"><text>Awesome hotel. Super modern, very friendly bilingual staff, nice location. The parking situation in the city is not the best of course, but for just a few dollars more than public parking. They will valet park your car- totally worth it. Oh, and good, speedy free wifi. We probably won't visit Montreal again, but if we did, we would go back to this hotel. Great experience!</text></sentence><sentence id="1286"><text>I still love this sushi house.  We visit a couple times a month over the last three-ish years and it's still awesome.  I can't believe we're lucky enough to have great sushi in our neighbourhood.</text></sentence><sentence id="1287"><text>Excellent Brazilian Steakhouse.  13 different kinds of meat, hot &amp; cold buffet items that are fantastic and dessert buffet my hubby squeezed in at the end.  I was too stuffed to partake in dessert but it looked very yummy.   I've been to the other Brazilian places in town and this one shot to the top for us.  We considered keeping this place secret but we just can't...it's that good.  Great service and wonderful ambiance rounded out this visit.  We will be back.  Highly recommend!</text></sentence><sentence id="1288"><text>You never know what kind of beer will be on top. If you love trying beers you don't see on a regular basis, go to Beer Revolution!  The beer list changes right before you eyes.  Food is a good complement (pizza is awesome) but you really go here for the beer experience.</text></sentence><sentence id="1289"><text>Went for Hubby's birthday and had a wonderful experience.  

We had the Cold Smoked Elk Carpaccio, Pickled Blueberries, First Pressed Canola &amp; Foie Gras Parfait, Apple Bourbon Gel&#233;e, Compressed Apple to start.  Excellent choices!  I'm not a pate fan but the Foie Gras was fabulous.  

For dinner, Hubby had the Seared Halibut, White Bean and Chorizo Ragout, Clams, Blistered Cherry Tomato Sauce Vierge and I had the Birch Smoked Duck Breast, Steel Cut Oat and Mushroom Risotto, Braised Red Cabbage, Natural Duck Jus.  Absolutely delicious!  

And we ended with Brie Cheesecake, Poppy Seed Honey, Raspberry Fluid Gel - yeah, not so much. I love Brie and I love cheesecake but together, not so fabulous.  Just not my taste I guess.

All in all, a great experience I would definitely repeat.</text></sentence><sentence id="1290"><text>Great pho, awesome spring rolls.  Hubby loved the Thai Satay Chicken soup.  Service was fantastic!  Definitely will be going back often.</text></sentence><sentence id="1291"><text>Not pleased with the sneaky upsale.  I haven't had nails for years and I wanted to treat myself. I wanted acrylic but apparently "acrylic" sounds like UV gel with shellac.  They started with acrylic tips and I'd never had gel before so I didn't know what they were doing until it was too late.  Wasn't pleased with the gel nails either - super thick and they were totally skimpy with the nail colour.  I will never again get gel nails and I certainly won't be back where I don't get what I asked for in the first place.  They completely ignored what I asked for and put the most expensive nail service they have on me.  It wasn't until I paid that I knew exactly what service I had received.  Not impressed!</text></sentence><sentence id="1292"><text>YUM!!  I've been searching for a Pho spot for awhile now.  Nothing compares to this place. I had the #2-Rare Beef Pho and hubby had A-Sate Chicken.  Broth was excellent and flavourful. Hubby said it's the best Sate he's ever had and the shredded chicken just melted in his mouth.  He loved it so much, it brought tears to his eyes.  Service was wonderful as well.  If you love Pho, you need to come here!  Do it!</text></sentence><sentence id="1293"><text>O-M-G!  I used to go for brunch with my mother at the Inn at Lake Bonavista.  Lets just say, I've come home again!  I wanted the brunch at The Lake House to take me back to all those years of wonderful brunch in a spectacular environment.  I was definitely not disappointed.  The two different kinds of eggs benny had me giddy - I chose one and my Mother chose the other - both are fantabulous!  My hubby and stepfather chose the brisket which both spoke very highly of.  The blood orange mimosas were fantastic and the sticky toffee pudding was divine.  We will definitely be back sooner rather than later.  I can't wait to have dinner!</text></sentence><sentence id="1294"><text>I love this place!  When I have a hankering for the best burrito in town, Mucho Burrito is the only place I go.  I usually have a regular barbacoa (shredded beef) burrito with brown rice, black beans, saut&#233;ed veggies and lots of extra cilantro on a whole wheat tortilla...YUM!  I've been here several times and I'm never disappointed.</text></sentence><sentence id="1295"><text>After desperately searching for good pho and reading these reviews, I thought I'd give this little place a try.  Staff was awesome but the pho and spring rolls...not so much.  I always order the rare beef pho wherever I go. I'm not a big fan of fatty beef but I had to order the one with the fatty brisket to get my rare beef.  Broth was different than I've had before and pretty good - had a nutmeg like taste to it.  Little disappointed there were no basil leaves to add though.  The spring rolls were meh and the shrimp salad rolls were empty - three shrimp, some noodles and a sprig of lettuce (I mean sprig too).  All in all, wasn't horrible, just meh.</text></sentence><sentence id="1296"><text>Kildare's is our go-to pub.  It's not even in our neighborhood but worth the drive.  Food is great, beer is awesome, staff is fabulous.  We sit at the bar so our service is always fantastic.  I have not experienced the inattentive staff issues mentioned in other reviews.  My food is never cold, which was also mentioned in other reviews.  If it was, I would send it back and give them a chance to correct before mentioning it in a review.  Never had a problem with the service or food.  I highly recommend this pub to everyone I meet.</text></sentence><sentence id="1297"><text>I've been going to Bolsa for a few years now and I just realized I've never written a review for it.  I love Bolsa. I usually get beef pho with a side of spring rolls.  Yum!  But recently, I've branched out and tried other things on the menu. My favourite so far has to be Happy's Coconut Rice - phenomenal.  And the homemade hoisin sauce is outstanding - I don't like sweet very much and the sauce has just enough sweet without going overboard.  I introduced some friends to Bolsa and now it seems Bolsa gets picked whenever someone celebrates a birthday.  Highly recommend Bolsa!</text></sentence><sentence id="1298"><text>Not my favourite Pho house but more than adequate.  Helps it's also in one of my favourite shopping areas.  My usual is spring rolls and rare beef pho.  I never leave unsatisfied and it's definitely good value for my money.  Definitely recommend if good, decent pho is what you're craving.</text></sentence><sentence id="1299"><text>This is my local Joe's and I love coming here.  I've had various menu items and I have never been disappointed.  When I'm looking for some comfort food and a good beer, this is one of my first choices.  Staff is always friendly and fast.  Never had a bad or meh experience.</text></sentence><sentence id="1300"><text>Excellent Chinese restaurant.  Food was fast, hot and delicious.  We had ginger fried beef, moo goo gai pan and mushroom fried rice.  Everything was fantastic.  Service was great and the bill was decent.  Lots of pickups while we were eating so the food is definitely popular.  I think we've found our new "local" Chinese restaurant.</text></sentence><sentence id="1301"><text>We went to Avec Bistro for our anniversary in June 2013 and it was beyond our expectations. The food was fabulous and the service was exceptional.  I had the duck and my husband had the lamb. Both were outstanding - I really dislike lamb but this was so good, even I would order the lamb.  We had some questions about wine pairings and suggestions given by our waitress were bang on. Everything about Avec Bistro gave us such a fantastic meal experience that we will definitely be back soon.</text></sentence><sentence id="1302"><text>We've had Pho at different places all over the city.  When I want Pho, this is where I want to go. I don't know their secret but I love the spring rolls and rare beef pho made here. Nothing else seems to compare for me.  We will drive across the city to go here for inexpensive, fantastic Pho!</text></sentence><sentence id="1303"><text>I've been searching for some decent Pho in the south part of Calgary.  Out of all the places I've tried, this one is the best by far (although, still not my favourite).  When I get a hankering for rare beef pho with a side of spring rolls, this is where I'll be going...at least until I find that elusive favourite.  Still, will worth it and the staff is very friendly.</text></sentence><sentence id="1304"><text>Ate the Thursday special,  Philly cheese Steak and it was good.

Not impressed with the place at all.</text></sentence><sentence id="1314"><text>Food was just okay, no employees were monitoring the games or rides, kids were climbing on and spinning on a ride that was broken and a teenage girl ran into my 4 yr old while running around in a circle to spin the broken ride, by this time I was extrememly angry and dragged a manager out to tape it up with caution signs, we will not go back.</text></sentence><sentence id="1315"><text>One of our favorite cupcake shops!

It comes with "roasted seasonal vegetables" which happened to be sweet potatoes and asparagus.  DELICIOUS!  

Another bonus is that they offer GLUTEN FREE options for the sandwiches.  Any sandwich can be served without bread over a bed of greens and sweet potatoes (excluding grilled cheese).  

Give it a try, it's WORTH it!</text></sentence><sentence id="1326"><text>Great place! Chris (the owner) was rock solid. The store is relatively small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in product quality and excellent customer service. The mattresses and adjustable frames are top notch and the prices are affordable. My fiance and I looked pretty much everywhere before stepping foot in Mattress 360. I'm glad we waited. Sleeping like a log!</text></sentence><sentence id="1327"><text>Service was great, and the food was tasty, but I had an experience that left a bad taste in my mouth. My bill came out to $23 and some change, and I paid cash with two $20 bills. When the server came to take my payment, he asked if I wanted change.... really. Sorry, bud, it was good, but not tipping 75% good. Then, when he brings me my change, he kept the coins for himself and gave me only the bills. If this is customary at upscale restaurants (or those that are trying to be) then I'm not "A-OK" with that, and that's why I'm giving L'Albatros a 2-star rating. I wasn't going to make a scene over 70 cents in front of my party, but I needed to share this experience so others are aware.</text></sentence><sentence id="1328"><text>Delicious food and comfortable atmosphere. The cafeteria-style line is different but it made the experience unique. The piano player was a nice touch. My only complaint is the price tag - they have no servers but the final cost is a bit high for what you get, almost as if they've added in a gratuity anyway. 15% cheaper fare would get 5-stars from me.</text></sentence><sentence id="1329"><text>Old Man Bar is the best. Perhaps it's not for everyone but there is no better weekday bar than OMB. Weekends can be a different story - during the summers the clientele tends to be 30-to-40-something "guidos" on Friday and Saturday night - but for the rest of the week it's a great place to drink. Mike and Keith are funny, friendly, and generous. Best bartenders ever!</text></sentence><sentence id="1330"><text>Lots of choices on tap for beers for good prices.. they also change out their selections pretty regularly. Food is iffy (the corned beef hash is the diamond in the rough) and a strange smell emanates from this place. Bartenders are pretty friendly.</text></sentence><sentence id="1331"><text>Party of two, but didn't get noticed until over 20 minutes after we got seated and the food took well over an hour to reach us. The food was good, but not worth the wait or the price tag. The problem is the management - only one waitress worked the entire floor on a weekend evening! She had a couple bussers to help but it wasn't enough. Unless I hear that things have changed, I'll never go back.</text></sentence><sentence id="1332"><text>I've been to Falafel at various times and days but the service remains consistently good. It usually takes just over 5 minutes for me to get my meal and never more than 10. The cost for a full meal - e.g. a bowl of soup, a sandwich, and a drink - is pretty good (~$10), and they have daily specials which are even cheaper. I've not had a bad experience here.

My only complaints, albeit minor, are a) that the sandwich wraps tend to be a little juicy/greasy for my liking; b) they generally won't bring you refills unless you go to the front counter or ask them as they walk through the dining room.</text></sentence><sentence id="1333"><text>Many good things to say about Zanzibar. My exposure to their entire menu is limited, but what I had was delicious. You have to get the walleye cakes! Their chicken and cornbread is also very good. The kool-aid is overpriced but it is delicious.

The waitstaff was professional and the atmosphere is very relaxed.

Price tag is pretty good considering the amount and quality of the food you get.

My only complaint is the speed of service, but I haven't been there enough times to really deduct points because of it (may have been isolated incidences).

edit: I've been a few more times, and the speed or service hasn't really changed. They dining room temperature is also a little too toasty for my liking. Food is still delicious, though.</text></sentence><sentence id="1334"><text>I had the Weiner schnitzel and my girlfriend had the Gypsy's cutlet. It was good, not great. I have to deduct points for inattentive servers and expensive fare ($43 for two people - just too much). Also they feel the need to remind you several times via their menu that it costs them money to accept credit cards - come on. They also automatically threw on a 15% gratuity. OK experience but I probably won't be returning.</text></sentence><sentence id="1335"><text>NOT child-friendly in child-friendly Leslieville.  After walking 1 hour to get our baby to sleep, looking forward to a quiet lunch &amp; a pint at the completely empty Roy, their bartender watched as I struggled to get my stroller through TWO heavy doors before informing me that "actually, we don't allow strollers in the restaurant" (i.e., We hate children.).   

Still hungry, thirsty, and well-deserving of a baby-break, we backtracked to longstanding Leslieville institution Velvet, and were warmly received.    

BTW, I parked my baby stroller next to the owner's scooter by the back booth.</text></sentence><sentence id="1336"><text>So I really don't want to give this place two stars b/c this really doesn't reflect the food, but I have to b/c the service is sooooo slow! 

We had made a reservation for 9 and got there around 8:30 and they were able to seat us after about 10 minutes. Our waitress came over pretty quickly after we sat down but then it just went downhill from there. We had ordered drinks and the waitress brought my friend the wrong beer. We then ordered edamame and a bunch of sushi cut rolls, We were really hungry b/c we had just traveled to Vegas and went straight to dinner from the airport. We ordered the spicy tuna, salmon avocado, shrimp tempura and spicy scallop rolls. It then took about 45 mins. to get our rolls and we were starving! We ate those rolls pretty fast once they got to the table. We were still hungry, so for some reason we thought it would be a good idea to get some more rolls. Bad idea. The next set of sushi rolls took another hour. We almost wanted to cancel the order b/c it was taking so long. We were hungry but also tired and just wanted to get out of there. 

After we finally got the second set of sushi rolls, we immediately asked for our bill b/c we knew that would take a while, which we were right about. 

After about another 20 minutes, we were able to pay our bill and leave. 

As far as the sushi goes, it was really good. Our favorite was the shrimp tempura. Our least favorites were the spicy scallop and tuna b/c they were not spicy. 

The whole meal lasted almost 2.5 hours, which is pretty ridiculous. Not sure if I would go back b/c I don't think I have the patience.</text></sentence><sentence id="1337"><text>We wanted to get married by an "Elvis" for our Vegas wedding and we were referred to Roland by where we were getting married (Denny's) and he was great!!  He was very nice and took the time to incorporate some things he had just learned about us into the ceremony.  His Elvis impersonation was great and his singing was really good!!  I would definitely recommend him!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1338"><text>I made a reservation for a friend's birthday and went through the Bellagio concierge.  I had tried to make my reservation on the restaurant website but it said I had to call.  I should have done it through OpenTable b/c I never have problems with them.  The concierge had told me the dress was business casual and men cannot wear shorts, but when we were seated, I saw plenty of men wearing shorts, so that was a little irritating. 

Our dinner was great though!!!  I had ordered a dirty martin, but there was barely any olive juice in it, so I asked for more on the side.  For our appetizer, we got the charcuterie board, which was so good!!  The pickles were the best part!! They also give you really good bread and olive tapenade which was excellent.

For my entree, I had the seafood risotto, which was so good.  I probably shouldn't have eaten all the bread because I was getting really full, but I managed to eat almost all of my entree.  I also tried the tenderloin which was excellent!!  My friends also ordered the scallops for their meal, which they say was really good as well!!

We were really full for dessert, but we were celebrating a birthday, so we somehow ordered 3 desserts for 5 people!!  They did put a candle on one of the desserts, so that was nice.  
We tried the banana tiramisu, the chocolate peanut butter lava cake and the cookie butter creme brulee.  All of which were wonderful!!!!  We couldn't stop eating even though we were so stuffed!!!!  

Overall, the dinner was great and I definitely recommend this place!</text></sentence><sentence id="1339"><text>We wanted something somewhat quick and thought this cafe would be good.  There was about a 5-10 min wait for a table and we were seated with a really good view of the pool area.  Then it went downhill from there.  

It took forever to put in a drink order and then once we got it, the drinks weren't even right.  We ordered 3 mimosas and one bloody mary and she brought 2 bloody marys and 2 mimosas, except the mimosas were just champagne.  

Once we ordered our food, it took forever to get the food!!!  Then when she did bring it, she gave some of our things to another table and then we had to wait for her to bring out new stuff!!  Even through all of that, the food was just ok.  I would just avoid this place and go somewhere else.</text></sentence><sentence id="1340"><text>Our friends who live in Las Vegas recommend we go here to meet them for brunch on Sunday.  I was able to make a quick and easy reservation on Opentable and even changed it a few times without any problems.
We were seated really quickly and had the best waitress named Darlene.  Were waiting for 3 people in our group and while we waited, Darlene brought us complimentary pigs in a blanket.  We also wanted mimosas and she suggested the bottomless so we can try different kinds and kept bringing us different varieties.

The lunch menu did look good but the brunch menu looked so good, we had to go with that.  It's basically small plates and you all share.  There's so much to choose from that Darlene said she will take control and bring us almost everything.  And she wasn't lying!!  We had so much food, we felt bad wasting stuff when we were getting so full!!!!  Everything was fantastic!!  The one thing that we thought would be good was the churro tots.  They were a bit underwhelming, but still good.  

We were celebrating two birthdays and Darlene even "sang" to our table!!  She was so funny and attentive and everyone should have her as their waiter!!  

I will tell everyone that goes to Vegas to go here because it was great!!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1341"><text>My friend was getting married in Las Vegas over the Memorial Day holiday and instead of having everyone spend a fortune at the fancy strip hotels, she picked the Tuscany, so everyone was able to get a good rate.

I was traveling with another one of my friend's and her husband and we got to the hotel around 2 p.m.  We waited in line to check in and asked if we could check in early.  We were told that the room that they held for us were given to people that stayed longer and that our rooms were not guaranteed, even though we booked them about a year in advance.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  We told her we were part of a wedding party that had blocked a bunch of rooms, but they still didn't care.  When they said they had 2 rooms available, the rooms were in 2 separate buildings away from where the bride had wanted us to stay.  We told the lady where we wanted to stay and she said come back in a hour and they should be ready.

We came back exactly an hour later, only to be told they weren't ready yet.  The lady had us sit and wait 20 more minutes while she waited on a call back to make sure the rooms were clean.  They also had one room with a King bed and one room with 2 doubles, even though my friend and I had both booked rooms with King beds.  I let her have the King room, but once again, what's the point of reserving a room, if you aren't going to get what you asked for.

My room was okay.  I didn't have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe.  I did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running.  That was really loud.  Also, even though there are shades to keep the light out, it was still bright once the sun started to rise and that made me wake up way earlier than I wanted to.

After the first day, my room was not cleaned by 3:00 p.m.  When I was getting ready to meet my friends, the cleaning lady came back around 3:30 p.m. and I told her I will be leaving soon and to come back.  On the day I was leaving, she knocked on my door at 9:00 a.m. to see when she could clean my room and I told her I was leaving today.  Shouldn't she know that?

The food at the Mexican restaurant and Marilyn's Cafe was just so-so.  We only ate there b/c there was noting else, but it wasn't that great.  I would have gone somewhere else, if there was something else close by.

The bar in the lobby would have been okay if it wasn't for the jazz music.  I'm not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it.  Also, the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous!!!  My friend and I ordered Shirley Temple's, which consist of Sprite and cherry flavor and they cost $4 each!!!!!!!!  What the heck!?  Also, a small bottle of water, about half the size of a regular bottle, was $4!!!  That is so ridiculous!

The pool was probably the only thing that wasn't that bad.  We were able to get lounge chairs both times we went to the pool.  I know people I was with were annoyed with the one waitress that was going around getting drink and food orders.  She was taking forever on some things and even gave food to the wrong people.  

On my last day, I had checked out and wanted to spend a few hours at the pool.  I went into the bathroom to change and I came out and put my stuff on the counter.  The cleaning lady was in there staring at me with an annoyed look, so I asked her if I was in her way.  She rudely said yes and I asked her if I should move to one side or something and she huffed out saying, something about coming back.  So uncalled for!!

When it was time to leave, we asked the bellman to get us a cab and he waited about 10-15 mins until he called for one, which of course made us late to get to the airport.

I definitely won't be staying at this hotel again.  I appreciate that my friend picked a  place to help all the wedding guests save money, but it was an awful experience.</text></sentence><sentence id="1342"><text>We ate at Fiamma before going to see Cirque de Soleil's Ka at MGM.  We made reservations for 6:45 p.m. and they were able to seat us right away.

The table was right by the entrance and my seat was right behind the menu where people walking by could check it out.  I didn't really like that table b/c a lot of people were walking by and then they were right next to the table looking at the menu.

Other than, that the food was excellent!  They gave us bread and olive oil, which was so good b/c we had two basket-fulls.  I ordered the sea bass and a side of potatoes and was completely stuffed.  I also had a glass of wine, which was great!  

The restaurant is definitely pricey and it would have been nice if it was a bit cheaper.</text></sentence><sentence id="1343"><text>My review is for the wedding services they provide.  When my now-husband and I found out that we could get married at Denny's we decided that we had to do it.  I received excellent service once I was put in touch with Sheila, the manager.  She explained to me what I options I could choose from and we went from there.  In the beginning, we had chosen the cheapest option, but we were upgraded because we had a special guest musician perform for us.  The upgrades were great!  The flower bouquet and boutonniere was so pretty!!!  The cake pops were delicious and the set up looked great!  We had also wanted an Elvis minister, so they put us in touch with one and he was fantastic!!  I would definitely recommend getting married at Denny's if you are thinking about getting married in Vegas!</text></sentence><sentence id="1344"><text>Love the atmosphere here, great place to hang out before dinner. We were pleasantly surprised to find out there is a brand new delicious food menu! Will be returning soon!</text></sentence><sentence id="1345"><text>Great service although I HD add to go through a couple of stylists before finding one that got my hair cut how I wanted</text></sentence><sentence id="1346"><text>I'm not a big coffee drinker but their breakfast bagels are amazing. I always go with the farmhouse, plain bagel and maple smear. It's like a home made breakfast in a sandwich. The staff are always nice and when they makes the occasional mistake, they get out fixed within a minute or two. Highly recommend.</text></sentence><sentence id="1347"><text>You always know what you're getting at Rudy's. Great service, great food and a really laid back atmosphere. There always something on the TV and great music playing at just the right volume.</text></sentence><sentence id="1348"><text>Even though we went in not long before closing, they were very helpful and took the time to answer all our questions. The return policy is great. We bought a greens supplement that tasted like horse pellets smell and they gave us a complete refund. Very friendly and very knowledgeable.</text></sentence><sentence id="1349"><text>Was in the area doing some shopping and decided I needed to eat. Was going to hit one of the old standbys in the immediate area and noticed this place. Was up for something new so gave it a try. Dan was behind the counter and I told him I had never been here. He gladly have me a quick but informative rundown of the menu and a couple recommendations. I ended up going with the kalua pork rice bowl and couldn't have been more pleased. A mostly sweet dish with just the right amount of savory. Place was very clean and the menu was very simple to navigate. They have a selection of hot and soy sauces to add to your dish but I didn't find them necessary. In the plethora of Asian style places these days, this is a definite standout.</text></sentence><sentence id="1350"><text>Went last week during the Happening Gourmand.  

From the fixed menu I chose the Garlic Escargot, Angus beef bavette, and Cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e.  

Given Narcisse was the least expensive of the Happening Gourmand restaurants I was pleasantly satisfied with the meal.   

In fact out of the 3 HG restaurants we tried Narcisse was my favorite.  

The standouts for me were -

The escargots  - nice twist on traditional escargots with cheese melted.
The beef bavette - inexpensive but well prepared piece of meat.
The french fries - savory and lots of them.

The service was a tad on the slow side but i think it was more to do with our waitress than systemic of the restaurant.</text></sentence><sentence id="1351"><text>I've eaten here several times now.  

Really enjoyed the ramen.  Large bowls brimming with tasty goodness.   Note, some bowls have more meat and toppings than others.

Gyozas are also very good and appear to be made in restaurant as opposed to the frozen bought variety.  

Chicken wings were also very good however last time they came undercooked.  

I'll give that a pass as until that dish everything has been great.  

Very attentive service.

Will be back again.</text></sentence><sentence id="1352"><text>If you're looking for the cliched Mexican restaurant with the Mariachis and frozen cocktails/margaritas then this place is for you.

Personally I prefer contemporary Mexican cuisine with good premium margaritas (not that Jose Cuervo/Sauza stuff).

Unfortunately, the food and service at Casa De Mateo were unremarkable as was the margarita.  

I don't know if we have much choice locally (would love to hear any suggestions), but I still think you need to head down south below the 49th parallel to find really good margaritas and Mexican food.</text></sentence><sentence id="1353"><text>Bleh.  Uninspired.  

Went to dine at Mechant Boeuf yesterday during the Happening Gourmand.  
Chose the goat cheese appy, Mechant Burger, and chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Nothing particularly good or bad.  
I would rate the food comparable to typical bar food.  

The bar is clearly the draw here ... might return for beverages but not to dine again.</text></sentence><sentence id="1354"><text>The Faubourg has seen better days but the Bagel Place continues to be one of my favorites.  

My favorite are the smoked salmon bagels.  

Large serving of smoked salmon and cream cheese on top of a delicious bagel.   

Can't beat that.</text></sentence><sentence id="1355"><text>I don't know what the last reviewer is talking about.

I'm Asian and lived in Vancouver most of my life so I would like to think I know a little about authentic Asian cuisine and this place is certainly not that.

"General Tao" and "authentic" don't belong in the same sentence together.  :P

Came here for lunch and tried the Pad Thai (not Chinese) and some fried beef dish.  
Food was edible, service thorough, but menu caters to a Western crowd.</text></sentence><sentence id="1356"><text>Decent prices if you wait for a special, buy in bulk,  or print out the online coupons.</text></sentence><sentence id="1357"><text>Ate here last week during the Happening Gourmand.

The food came out very quickly ... maybe too quickly you know what i mean?

It's a funny thing when it comes to quick service .... there's a fine line between an efficient waiter and feeling like they're trying to rush you out the door and get their tip.

Unfortunately it felt like the latter.

The meal was affordable and decent however nothing outstanding.</text></sentence><sentence id="1358"><text>I paid $48 for a gel manicure as well as a $14 tip for my technician, Simone. Unfortunately, my manicure fell apart within the first couple hours of getting it done. I decided to add gems, but they fell off my nails same day. Now my nails look tacky. I called back to ask if they can redo it. I was able to rebook with another technician. I also asked if it would cost anything, but the girl over the phone didn't know if I'd have to pay since it was a different technician. Also, I can see through some on the polish. Clearly, my gel manicure was not done properly. I decided to call back to cancel the reschedule appointment being that I do not have the time, and I don't want to pay for a mistake that is not mine.  I'm very disappointed. Your service is not even close to being worth $48.</text></sentence><sentence id="1359"><text>I've eaten gyros pretty much everywhere in AZ and this place is up there for one of the best!</text></sentence><sentence id="1360"><text>I stayed here after seeing rooms for $6.00 on Expedia, I really was thinking the worst. I have to say I cant wait to go back, the rooms are small but they are perfect for one or two people. The air condition works great, yes you need that in Vegas. All the staff was always nice , the valet people were always very friendly too. My room had a good bath tub, old school. Only complaint and its not a complaint the water in the shower must come from a volcano, dam its hot, guess to wash off the germs from the night. Late at night there was some working girls out on Fremont street if that's what your looking for, must have been the Tuesday night special because there were tons of them. Overall I will be back, good experience at the Golden Gate. Try the Dolly Parton Slots they are fun!</text></sentence><sentence id="1361"><text>Just being honest I think this place is overrated. Mac Donalds fish sandwich or it reminded me of Mrs Paul's frozen fish. Was not earth shattering. Would I eat here again maybe, I wouldn't go out of my way. Lived in Phoenix 3 years and always saw it but first time trying it.</text></sentence><sentence id="1362"><text>I recently filed bankruptcy and received a letter that they could finance me!. In fact I think they was the first out of like 75 I received. I called them and they said come out. What a joke. The first day I went we rode a golf cart to the back where all the dirty cars are and they kinda teased me showed me a really nice about a 2003 Camry with leather. I asked to drive it and I could only drive it down what looked like a residential neighborhood because he said the shop hadn't checked it out. They said they would work on the deal and they next day well they couldn't do it. They showed me a 2006 Civic that would be perfect, keep in mind 99k mile car, and the air condition was working but they would fix it, what a joke. Like $375 a month for 60 months and you can trade it in a year, yea right. Thank God I didn't buy here, Please shop around when you receive these letters. Try Camel back Ford they was the best and I wasn't treated like I have bad credit. The sales man was pretty cute in the Fast Loans Department but other than that what  a joke.</text></sentence><sentence id="1363"><text>I recently filed Bankruptcy and received at least 50 flyers in the mail from Larry Miller Dealerships wanting to finance me. What a joke. I signed up online filling out application, I was called from a salesman at Larry Miller Fiat, come on down we can get you in a car, we own the bank, Prestige Financial, what a joke!. He looked online at all there dealerships looking for the RIGHT car, he found one. 2010 Chevrolet Cobalt, I have never been in jail but I have seen jail cell movies that the jail cell looked cleaner, yea it had new tires and low 60k miles but  it was nasty inside. Like $366 for 66months and you can trade it after making 12 payments, yea right who wants a 2010 Cobalt you still owe 10k on lol. Please do yourself a favor when you receive these flyers and look around. Camel back Ford was the best place I went to and didn't treat me like I had bad credit.</text></sentence><sentence id="1364"><text>I ate there with a friend, it was just OK. I order the jade chicken and jerk chicken. My friend ordered same thing. The jade chicken was so tough like leather me and him both returned it.

I will go back but for my first time I wasn't really impressed but all business have there bad days.</text></sentence><sentence id="1365"><text>I am still fighting my nightmare aka case. I been very blessed and Victor was one of the biggest blessings of all bonding me out of jail. My family member is out of state she called at least 10 bail bonds places that was rude, wouldn't help her or wanted her to bring a vehicle and leave it for collateral. Keep in mind she's 2000 miles away. Victor from the start worked with her, was honest about the hole process. Victor sent his amazing coworker Katrina to have my paperwork filled out. Boom I was out of jail hell, first time in my life in jail scared to death, still scared. I go check in with Victor on Fridays it's more than a check in usually. He gives me hope when sometimes I don't have it. He helps me to believe everything is going to work out. He treats you like a friend not a criminal, yes if you mess up he's gonna get you like Ru Paul says dont fuck it up, you treat him like he treats you, you get the awesome blessed Dignity Bail Bonds experience. I truly recommend him to anyone and not just because he got me out of jail because he's fair, has a awesome energy about him, overall great business. Go Dignity Bail Bonds!!! Go Victor!!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1366"><text>I ate here after reading the reviews on yelp. It was just OK, I got the big Jim. What aburger has gravy and biscuits that's just as good.  Looked like a bunch of goth skater cooks trying to serve some home style food. My friend ate with me and he wasn't very impressed either. I had a QT cup because QT ice tea is bomb and one of the skater workers said because of the liqueur license I had to throw it away. It was ok, I went, I probably wouldn't go back.</text></sentence><sentence id="1367"><text>Best meal I've had in a long time! We started with the dim sum platter which was just incredible, especially the duck dumpling. We then had the spicy prawn, black truffle duck and Asian greens with ginger. The flavour in each dish was just amazing. The banana peanut dessert was the perfect ending to the delicious meal. The Hakka cocktail is not to be missed.</text></sentence><sentence id="1368"><text>Ate here based on a suggestion. Waitress was friendly but when asked what she recommends, she spoke really quickly and we didn't understand any of what she recommended. 

Food was very yummy but very small servings - I guess that's tapas for you! 

Cucumber Mist cocktail was great. 

Fantastic view. Best to request a window seat or even a table on the patio. Sat by the window and we weren't disappointed.</text></sentence><sentence id="1369"><text>Posted some photos from the experience my wife and I had yesterday at Paramount - Heartland location, you be the judge. We were there at 5pm, it wasn't busy at all. The food served to us wasn't fresh, I am so disappointed and I felt cheated when I saw the condition of the food which was served to us. I am not a difficult customer and I don't create a scene either but since yesterday I can't forget the worst experience I have had and the upset stomach. There were pieces of chicken skin fat in my shawarma platter and the salad was stale, the fattoush salad we order didn't have the crispy chunks of fried pita it comes with. Small portions with lots of stale fries , is this what you call fine foods?! The service was extremely slow, we had to look for someone to give us more pita bread. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, we clearly mentioned our table number to the server and she ended up serving the bread at another table. I spent most of time time scavenge through our order and left with plates full of old food which seemed microwaved. $45 for two platters and fattoush salad.</text></sentence><sentence id="1370"><text>Great moroccan / tunisian food, served in small 'tapas' like portions or as full meal.  Great setting for a drink / coffee. See my earlier description.</text></sentence><sentence id="1371"><text>Do not order to-go from this place. I was told it would take 35-45 minutes for delivery, but after an hour I called to check on my order and was given a "sorry, he just headed out." Another half hour later I had to call and cancel my order because I could not wait anymore. I was out on hold 3 times. Poor service and it sounded as if the employees were clueless on what to do. I got no explanation as to why it took so long. Disappointed.</text></sentence><sentence id="1372"><text>My boyfriend first started coming here when he injured himself during a workout and has been coming for months! He absolutely loves Dr. Reed! Reed has truly helped his back and he's far better than from before. (He used to sleep on a tennis ball due to discomfort) 

He then referred my roommate who works an office job. The slouching and being hunched over quite often has taken a toll on him so he came in and loved Reed as well! (He had gone to a different chiro prior and made the switch). 

I caved and stopped in myself. I am a server and carry heavy items and trays so my lower and mid back are always aching. I'm still just 20 but ever since coming here I've felt a huge difference in my whole body! I'm definitely happy with where these sessions are going. I'm aware of my posture at all times and that has helped me breathe better and digest better. Reed is very attentive to how your body works and since he's suggested better sleeping positions for me, my nights have gotten significantly better. 

Grace up front is a gem I can't forget about! She's very sweet and kind, always picking up on conversations, and just brightens up my afternoons! 

Everyone is great so even if you stop in just to check it out or ask questions, totally worth it!</text></sentence><sentence id="1373"><text>I've been to two other Enterprises and I have to say, this location has been the best! Everyone here is very friendly, especially Tyler. Exceptional service, made renting a car super easy for me, and was able to go through all the paper work and whatnot in no time! I work in customer service myself, dealing with people everyday, so I really appreciate workers like him who not only make your experience better, but remember you and pick up conversations from where you left off. 

Definitely recommend this location if you're in Tempe / Mesa! All of the associates are wonderful, but if you can, speak to Tyler, he will take care of you no problem!</text></sentence><sentence id="1374"><text>I love this place! Great flavor in all the dishes I've tried, my all time fave is the Chinese Lettuce Wraps! Lunch is definitely the best time to go, excellent portions and affordable prices. I plan on working my way down the entire lunch menu! Walking in, the lighting is beautiful and natural because of the big windows, it's super open space, high ceilings, cute decor, this place is modern and lovely. All the servers have been genuine and kind also! 

Highly recommend for a quick bite, or even a nice family friends dinner :)</text></sentence><sentence id="1375"><text>I've struggled with mild-severe acne since high school and finally at 22, I've found peace. I had been seeing another dermatologist and esthetician in ahwatukee, but needed to search for a more natural and friendly office. I love how cozy the space is when you walk in and how family-oriented the workers are. 

My first visit was just a quick exam with suggestions of switching out chemical-filled products. I was even gifted a sample for my inflamed cystic acne. The Green Tea Gel Cleanser, I believe. I like it for when I don't wear make up and just need a quick clean at the end of the night. 

On my second visit, I had the pleasure of getting a personalized facial from Diana, who I adore! She's super informative and really taught me a lot about how my diet would affect my break outs. I kid you not, after cutting down on gluten (was hard since I work at a brewery) and dairy like Diana recommended, my skin smoothed out almost instantly. Anyways, after my rejuvenating, relaxing, and gentle facial, I was gifted another sample. The Clove Gel! Immediately after using this gel, my redness calmed down, my oils weren't as crazy, and I definitely saw improvements on my face. It makes my face feel super smooth and cool. 

I just went in for my third visit, only to purchase that Clove Gel she gave me a sample of. I can't wait to see Diana again so I can ask her about what products I should use next since my acne is almost gone and I only have scars and hyper-pigmentation. 

I truly appreciate how friendly the team is and how helpful they are with the products they carry. They have a line exclusive to them I think, and it's mostly natural/organic, which I love! I'm actually bringing three of my friends in for facials/check-ups because I like this practice so much!</text></sentence><sentence id="1376"><text>I love this salon, it will be my new go-to for touch ups, if i need a special do, or just a regular trim! Bree, was so helpful since I hadn't gone to a salon in such a long time. She was able to quickly see what it was that my hair needed and how to frame my face correctly, which I had trouble with. She was able to transform my thick and broken hair into a chic and cute look with flexible layers and volume! 
HIGHLY recommend this place!</text></sentence><sentence id="1377"><text>I love this place! Front desk is always friendly and never hesitate to start up a nice conversation. Rachel is an absolute saint! She's helped me so much by ridding bad make up in my collection, recommending better regimens and routines for my mild acne, and teaching me new things about my own skin! It's a bonus that they remember you and your concerns from the last visits!</text></sentence><sentence id="1378"><text>My absolute favorite spot for ramen, fried appetizers, and even sushi rolls. I love that they offer a little bit of everything because sometimes that's what I want. Its such a clean and neat place with the friendliest servers and chefs. Alan, who is a chef there is personable and knows how to take care of his guests. Every visit is like I'm seeing a friend while enjoying his creations. 

My boyfriend loves the tonkatsu ramen there and I can't get enough of their chicken or pork katsu. So thin and crispy, paired with fluffy white rice is heaven. Try the croquettes for a solid snack or  octopus appetizer if you dare! Go with friends to order a bit of everything and eat family style or go on your lunch break for a quick and heart meal. It's great for all!</text></sentence><sentence id="1379"><text>This is my go-to for any meal honestly. I love how quick and easy everything is. The service can be strange to those who aren't used to Asian owned establishments. But I enjoy that there's no forced conversations and unnecessary check ups on us while we eat. So, service is straight to the point and quick! 
The food though, is never disappointing for me. I choose to eat here for hang overs, for a quick lunch, and sometimes even just a quick spring roll snack. 
I highly recommend! It's just delicious food with good service and the owner will always remember your face :)</text></sentence><sentence id="1380"><text>I just want to start off by saying, this store is my favorite place to grocery shop. All the cashiers are friendly and always give cold water bottles when it's extra hot out and sometimes even little yogurt treats. I come here for 90% of my groceries. Amazing!!

They sell basic produce and in an environmentally friendly fashion. Nothing is ever overstocked (which goes to waste) to look glamorous like at big grocery stores, but there's just enough fresh goods for daily shoppers. 

I can find the best meats here! I only come here for my Korean BBQ meats, stew meats, and anything else I need for soups or broths. It's always looking fresh and for items that are about to go bad, instead of throwing it out, they put them out at a discounted price. 

I also love the packaged lunches they make everyday. There's beef or fish cake kimbap, kimchi stew, pan-fried fish, eel, a bunch of side dishes by the check-out station, and even fresh sweets like mochi and pastries.</text></sentence><sentence id="1381"><text>My girl friend and I went in around 1pm for two pedicures and two gel manicures and were out of there by 2:10pm! I was greeted right away and directed to the nail polishes and massage chair immediately after. Everything was amazing! The prices are reasonable and I felt that that service matched, if not more. The deluxe pedicure was excellent. Hot stones, towels, and sugar scrub!! Super relaxing. The best part was I never felt awkward and the workers were extremely friendly. 

Will be back again!</text></sentence><sentence id="1382"><text>I just wanna say, THANK YOU KEVIN. This beautiful human being showed me the difference between amazing and not so amazing piercers. I made the mistake of falling for a $30 deal at Next Level Piercing &amp; Tattoos and was stuck with a giant retainer that literally hit my upper lip when I talked. 

Kevin was able to swiftly and painlessly switch out the jewelry for me. It wasn't a big process for him or anything but I just really appreciate how gentle he was with my bruised septum. I didn't even feel him take out the old retainer to put in the new jewelry! 

For future piercings, I will be back. Also, if you are thinking of getting anything done, do it here. You get a gorgeous selection of jewelry as well as skilled hands doing the job.</text></sentence><sentence id="1383"><text>Love, love, love this place. Everything from how family oriented it is to the quick and easy combos they offer. Nothing makes it feel more authentic than the homey atmosphere and friendly workers that have been around forever. Tom, the owner, always remembers everyone's names and picks up conversations right where you left off. 

Pricing is extremely affordable and the food is delicious! I love the Dan Dan noodles the most. Such wonderful flavors and always have enough for the next day. 

The only con I've experienced is the lack of service sometimes. However, keep in mind, traditional Asian food service is extremely casual and they try not to bother you while you eat. 

If you're looking for a quick, inexpensive bite of Chinese, I'd stop by!</text></sentence><sentence id="1384"><text>Hands down, best sushi place I've ever been to. Customer service is always a must have with me and this place is all about it! Have had every server (been there that much) and they are all friendly, know the menu, and recommend the best specials! The sushi is amazing, don't be afraid to ask what's good that day because the chefs know what's up!! Atmosphere is never a let down. You find yourself conversing with the boss in no time, which makes you feel really welcome :)</text></sentence><sentence id="1385"><text>Been here with different friends more than twice now and will be returning. Service is always great, Kevin is our favorite server! He's kind and attentive, but most importantly, he's able to help me decide on which dish I want to try :) 

Kimchi fried rice is a must try classic!
Spicy rice cakes with ramen and meats is a little bland but I can tell the flavors are there :) 
Spicy squid salad is delicious as well as the bulgogi rice! 

Get it all!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1386"><text>I forgot all about Lee's sandwiches after coming here. I especially love their baguettes and affordable prices. There's not much to say other than amazing banh mi and great for if you need a quick but filling bite. Try their omelette banh mi!</text></sentence><sentence id="1387"><text>Nothing that I don't like about this place! Love that the establishment is clean (tables, booths, utensils, glassware), and the interior is decorated to give a nice, soothing atmosphere. Perfect lunch portions for an affordable price. Service is quick and usually at lunch they don't talk/bother you much, which I enjoy. Sushi rolls are outstanding, love the way they're held together and the texture of the rice! I always come here for an easy meal :)</text></sentence><sentence id="1388"><text>I love coming here because it's convenient and I know it's clean! They're always so kind, energetic, and pick up on conversations wherever you left off. 

Service is fantastic, but they often struggle with timing and getting their appointments in along with walk-ins. Ive had to wait a few times regardless of calling to set a time up.</text></sentence><sentence id="1389"><text>Despite being 22, I've got quite a long history with dentists. I grew up without proper dental visits, resulting in 4 decayed molars. 

At 18, I took myself to one of those chain dental offices and paid over $1500 for two root canals. I was never given an explanation as to what a root canal was or that I'd need to pay for crowns separately. So, I got the roots taken care of but due to insufficient funds (because I'm 18!) I couldn't afford crowns to keep them secure. 

From 19-21, I hopped from local dentists to dental schools, and even Mexico to save money on the treatments (crowns, bone grafts). I couldn't pull through with most places because they were discomforting and too business-like. 

Finally I found this place on yelp and after the consultation with Dr. Walker, I knew I could trust his work. He thoroughly went over my teeth, proposed a treatment plan, and even broke it down into separate operations to help lessen the financial stress. Most dental places feel fancy and the work they suggest never seems necessary (like they just want my money), but here, I understood the importance of each extraction and surgery because Dr. Walker took the time to explain things. 

In the past few months we extracted a tooth, did a bone graft, and a root canal retreatment. All were extremely terrifying at first, but I trusted him. Everything went smoothly and even when the retreatment got complicated Dr. Walker comforted me by staying positive and updating me throughout the procedure. (The scariest thing is hearing someone say "oh no" without a follow-up) To be honest, I was trying to stay awake so I could keep my mouth open; it was that easy-going in the room. 

I genuinely appreciate the work he's done and can't say enough about how great my endo experience was. 

*the receptionists and assistants are always a pleasure as well. It's pretty family-oriented in there so they tend to remember you!</text></sentence><sentence id="1390"><text>Love this place! It's pretty far out for me but I don't mind making the drive to eat here. A place that offers a mix of Korean and Japanese foods is all I need in life. The staff is super friendly and I love how they can remember my order! The beer selection is fantastic, the edamame is Better than most, and the spicy soondubus are amazing! 

Update: they recently changed their name to K Sushi!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1391"><text>I took my car in for service today. The service manager, Leanne, who helped me was fantastic. Great customer service skills, professional and a nice overall person. Thank you for going the extra mile to help me.</text></sentence><sentence id="1392"><text>Great experience all around ... from the minute you walk in and interact with Rebecca and Samantha, to the interaction with Dr. Marshall and Michelle. Nice competent friendly professional people.</text></sentence><sentence id="1393"><text>Terrible customer service. Terrible. I took my Honda truck to this location for an oil change. When I said to Carlos, the manager on duty, that the $79 he quoted me seemed much higher than the dealer, he went to tell me in a rude way that "we make our money changing oil and the dealer makes their money selling cars". He then walked away. 

As rude as it gets. No clue how to treat a customer. 

I ended up getting my truck serviced at a local Honda dealership. Oil change plus tires rotated in 45 minutes for $66 including tax. 

Stay away from this jiffy lube location.</text></sentence><sentence id="1394"><text>Good chicken. Horrible service. Drive through attendant was rude and obnoxious. And our order couldn't have been more wrong .

They also serve beer!</text></sentence><sentence id="1402"><text>If you're looking for a facial, Brandi is the girl to see!  She recommended a product months ago that has worked to clear up my skin and I got the pleasure of having her give me a facial.  She's knowledgeable, kind, and overall a great resource for skin on this side of town!  I already scheduled my next appointment :)</text></sentence><sentence id="1403"><text>I just had the best hair experience with Katie.  She was attentive, honest, and very easy to talk to.  I moved to Arizona 5 years ago and kept getting my hair done by sub-par stylists.  More recently, I had a hair disaster (at an unnamed salon) that Katie fixed for me and I couldn't be happier.  She asked me to scheduled a consultation and she explained exactly what she could do.  She did not make false promises.  She was honest and I appreciate that. I love my hair and although this Dolce is a bit out of my way, I will be a regular client.</text></sentence><sentence id="1404"><text>I visit S&amp;V quite often. Mostly for take out of pizza. Thin and crispy and light. Good toppings. Occasionally on the dry side but if you like "neapolitan" style then you'll be a fan. Great portabella mushroom panini sandwich and kale salad!</text></sentence><sentence id="1405"><text>After visiting Naples, Italy and experiencing true Neopolitan pizza, i can say Pomo's is the closest thing you will find to this amazing style of pizza. I've been to many pizza places in the scottsdale/phoenix area and by far this is the best and most authentic. If you have a chance, also try their mushroom soup - very good!</text></sentence><sentence id="1406"><text>Superior Tire handles all oil changes and services for my vehicles.  They offer great pricing, all work is done in a timely fashion and the staff is very knowledgeable as well as helpful.  They work on all makes and models, and provide very reliable workmanship.  Stephen, the Store Manager, is always there, always friendly and always willing to beat anyone's prices!  Ask for Jameson when it's time to make an appointment or have any questions - he has the answers and is happy to help!  I highly recommend Superior for all your vehicle service needs!</text></sentence><sentence id="1407"><text>Best Buffet, I ever had. I would absolutely recommend to all friends traveling to Vegas. The food is very fresh and delicious and the customer service is great.</text></sentence><sentence id="1408"><text>Customer service is terrible. I had a reservation for non smoker room-at the check in, I was told they had only smoker room and all rooms are booked. I stayed in this Hotel from 06/29 to 07/04, i would not recommend this Hotel/casino for non smoker. The hotel should train its from desk/check in employee to listen to the customers because the hotel has lost me as a customer.</text></sentence><sentence id="1409"><text>Delicious food that is prepared quickly. We were visiting Charlotte from the DC area and needed something fast before heading to the airport to catch our flight. Right after we ordered I filled up my cup with some freshly brewed ice tea (sweet and unsweet) and by the time I walked outside to claim a table the food was ready. Fortunately they don't have that Gold Peak ( aka gold piss) crap that a lot of restaurants have in Maryland. I love brewed tea.... So we ate outside at one of the tables. There are only about 3-4 tables out front so most people just grab their food and go. Overall, a great place for gyros that is affordable and ready in a snap. I suspect other items on the menu are also tasty but I can only comment on what I ate and it was delicious!</text></sentence><sentence id="1410"><text>Review is based primarily on the beer and atmosphere. This truly is one of the best places to enjoy quality beer in a really impressive outdoor environment within the city limits. I stuck to a liquid diet for the evening as consumption of fine beer was my #1 objective. I appreciate that OMB brews according to the 1516 Bavarian Law of Purity....Unfortunately, a thunderstorm came through so we went inside and the facility inside is also quite nice. Overall, a great place to enjoy quality beer.</text></sentence><sentence id="1411"><text>Everything was really good. We loved the salsa bar with all the interesting choices.  Carne asada tacos were great. Can't wait to come back and try the fish tacos.</text></sentence><sentence id="1412"><text>The best creole in town!  Gotta come see Tippa.  She will rock your world. We loved the Creole and the pan roast!</text></sentence><sentence id="1413"><text>Awesome bright interior, fantastic service, vegetarian friendly and good atmosphere. I came with a friend for dinner and was definitely impressed. There was even a man playing guitar and singing Spanish love songs. The margs have real fruit and are definitely worth trying. Will be back.</text></sentence><sentence id="1414"><text>Regency is a great school to grow in. The educators are very down to earth, and Studio Luma gives you opportunity to get on the salon floor as soon as you start.

The piercers are friendly and professional. High quality beautiful jewelry. Definitely worth going put of the way for.</text></sentence><sentence id="1416"><text>I can't recommend Haulin' Goats enough.  The day before the goats came out, Heather stopped by and we showed her the area we want the goats to weed.  It was very easy and took very little time.  The next day the goats came over and went to work.  

The area the goats were weeding for us was overgrown with poison ivy, making it impossible for us to get in and weed ourselves.  The goats absolutely tore through the poison ivy.  In fact, the poison ivy seemed to be there favorite, because they ate it first.  Because it was a big area that was very overgrown, it took a 2-3 days, but the goats absolutely cleared everything out.  

The goats can't clear everything out like weed killer, but the most they left were a few small weeds sticking a few inches out of the ground.  We were very surprised how well it worked.  

Also, the area where the goats were focused was along the bank of a lake and we weren't sure how the goats would do, because a lot of the poison ivy was very close to the water.  But, the goats took care of everything.  

We were blown away with how well the goats worked out.  If you're looking for a non-chemical method to get rid of poison ivy/weeds, I can't recommend Haulin' Goats enough.  The process was easy and pain free and the kids in the neighborhood loved coming over to see the goats.</text></sentence><sentence id="1417"><text>I have been to this fine Gun Shop three times now. While they have a limited inventory of Bolt Action and wood stock rifles. How ever they do have a few good deals for Old School guys like me.

  Bottom line - Harlan was willing to work with this Visitor from California. In order to buy a rifle and have it legally shipped to the Peoples Republic of California.</text></sentence><sentence id="1418"><text>I came into town a week ago and was told to check this place out. Doing so I was very pleasantly surprised as they did not have the usual bad attitude of some gun shops that I have been to. ( I.E. "You do not know what the hell you are talking about". Or "Either buy something or get the F**k out of here")
 Instead they were very friendly and professional  to me and my wife. So I bought some parts for one of my guns and had them shipped to the Peoples Republic  of California. Today they showed up today in a flawless manner. So Well Done to all Hands. It was a very refreshing experience!
 
PS The Hot Dog place next door is also worth to looking into for a great Chicago Dog!</text></sentence><sentence id="1419"><text>I have now been to this great Gun Shop about 5 times. When ever I get into the Phoenix Area. I make a Bee Line to it. As a Californian, I have found these fine folks are willing to work with me. So that I can legally buy and ship a fire arm to the Peoples Republic.

  Bottom line I wish the Gun Shops in the Greater LA area would take a lesson from these folks.</text></sentence><sentence id="1420"><text>Another extremely good Gun Shop! I have been here several times when I am in the Phoenix area. These Folks really have their Sh*t together. 

Especially since I hail from the Peoples Republic of California. They are very willing to work with you so that you can legally get a fire arm back to the Motherland.

  They also have a huge and very reasonably priced inventory to boot. Time spent here usually is very well spent! Major Kudos to all hands involved!</text></sentence><sentence id="1421"><text>Very friendly folks. Really Clean. Bathroom was spotless. Food was outstanding. Crispy pork belly delicious.

After i googled on yelp i found this guy with a nice tittle ( save money towing) i thought to myself this can be a good choice. I called him and he said it cost 75$ to tow my car, and i said ok. He didn't show up at the time he gave me and it was like two hours later. 
He was so on rush at the time i was talking to mechanic and he kept saying "you killing me man" every single minute, as if he is doing a favor to me and it's all free. He ask me for 5$ more after i said i pay by debit card. This is exactly what i experience with him. i give him one star cuz i think he needs to be patient and respect the customer. He is not running a hotel he should know that his customer is in rough situation and he should help customer instead of making more stress on him or her.</text></sentence><sentence id="1426"><text>This guy is so friendly. And he knows what he's doing. He copied my car keys so fast. I recommend him to everyone.</text></sentence><sentence id="1427"><text>Seriously amazing service! Gerry was so helpful and accommodating. He responded to my emails within the hour. 

Their price for rental cars is insanely good. 

I rented from here twice in the past couple of weeks and each time I had a cute little Mazda 2, perfect for tricky Toronto traffic. 

Convenient central location in Kensington Market.

The staff loves their students.. They are all around great.. A cook for breakfast and lunch.. I never had no issues with this daycare at all..However.. You get what you pay for..

Her reply was " just to sit. " we started laughing , not high rollers at all. We gently walked ourselves over to the bar stools . Hahahaha.                                                    Over all experience was cool, not a bad seat In the house . Good choices for beers if that's your thing.

Now to the good part , the rooms are spectacular because there all suites ( with a door bell  ) Beautiful view of the strip and water show ( if your so lucky to get panoramic view). We were lucky !!

After ordering the double bacon burger and milk shake , mouth was waiting for explosion . Total flop after opening up the bag to see this small ass burger. Needless to say this place was a dud to me IMO . Oh yea the shake was also a bust for me . Never to return !! Glad there was no line when I went.</text></sentence><sentence id="1479"><text>Hit up the Monte Carlo to treat my mom and wife for there 1st time here. They were dressed in the all white of course . I've been to the other bar at Mandalay Bay so this is the same layout for me . Kind of small and quaint inside . My mom and wife really enjoyed  themselves and we stayed in ther for 30 min. Having 2 drinks and some good conversation about this experience . Nice bonding,  something unique and different that's for sure a  good time out , kind of pricey but well worth it for 1st timers !</text></sentence><sentence id="1480"><text>Bad customer service. I waited in lobby for 25 minutes and no one even came out to help me.</text></sentence><sentence id="1481"><text>This place has the best falafels! We have dinner here probably once a week and the food and service is always top notch! Everything we have tried on their menu is always good, the chicken special sand which is also another favorite and must try!</text></sentence><sentence id="1482"><text>I was really excited to visit this place because of its funky look and DDD. But it was a total let down. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it just us and like a couple of other tables so they were not busy at all and the service was so incredibly slow and bad. Our appetizer and the kids meal we ordered came out pretty fast but then we literally waited for like 30 minutes for our food which we learned later was just sitting under the heat lamps for like 15 minutes. There were like 3 servers hanging around not busy while our food just sat there. And our server was hanging out at a table sitting with them for like 10 minutes when our food was just sitting there. Finally we got up and asked where our food was and it still took another 5 or so minutes for someone to bring it. The tacos were soggy by this time and not good. Aside from the bad service the food was just a total let down. The kids meal was gross and our tacos were soggy and it seems the oil was old because everything fried had a bad taste to it. This was a bummer because this was a place we were excited to visit and we left not even enjoying or completing our meal.</text></sentence><sentence id="1483"><text>This place is so dirty and really bad customer service. And the worst thing is that on my last visit there and it will definitely be my last, the employee had a  CAT in the back of the kitchen running around. Which is so incredibly unsanitary especially around the food.</text></sentence><sentence id="1484"><text>Me and a group of friends went to this place one night when they had live music. We had a very bad experiance and ended up leaving because of the rude service. We were a small group and we are obviously different looking than the crowd in the restaurant. The servers at the bar where very rude and no one offered to take our order or seat us. Then there was an open booth near the front and we asked to sit at that table and one of the servers told us that it was taken even though no one was sitting there. Like 10 minutes later a white couple came in and they offered the booth to them. We finally realized that there was a back room with empty tables and we went and seated ourselves and literally waited for 15 minutes before anyone even walked over to our table to ask for our drinks. They saw us seat ourselves which is why we finally got the hint that we were not welcome and got up and left. I think unless your a local in the neighborhood I would not visit this place. Very rude and unwelcoming atmosphere.</text></sentence><sentence id="1485"><text>This place has a serious problem with unwelcoming and rude servers. We have been back a few times because the food is pretty good but each time the servers are always rude and not friendly at all! And the service is slow because they hangout in the back behind counter and talk.</text></sentence><sentence id="1486"><text>I met Ms. Roxana Valeton at the Rio Hotel Convention  Center during the Community Wellness and Resource  Fair. She was so sweet,  friendly  and accommodating. She told me about A New Day Community  Center and since I was new in town and looking for a doctor, I called for an appointment. 
The clinic had a friendly  atmosphere.  I found the staff extremely helpful and courteous.  My doctor, Dr. Mostafa Sheta, was very knowledgeable and professional. To top it all, they gave me samples of some of my medications. 
I have nothing but praises for this health center, go check it out!!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1487"><text>She's located 2 seconds from my house inside of the Sports Cuts salon I somehow managed to bypass for 10 years. Today was my first time ever coming to Shabi and it really felt like the thousandth! Right away she was so sweet and and treated me like a personal friend. I have no idea how, but she managed to work with what little brows I had and made them look amazing!! She is so precise and really knows what she's doing. I read all her reviews on yelp before deciding to go here and i'm so glad I did. I'm going to recommend her to everyone!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1488"><text>I gave this hotel 2 stars because I did not see any mice, roaches or bed bugs in my room.

The key to staying at this hotel is have your paperwork in order if you don't they will double charge you....that's just the way it is. I booked this hotel through priceline made sure not to give my credit card to the hotel.

Do not give these people your credit card. 

I wanted an early check-in but they wanted to charge me an additional $14.95 resort fee for checking in before 11am. The resort fee is an additional $14.95 per night. I waited until 11am to check in.

The resort fee is for internet service in your room supposedly...I believe it's just a way for the hotel to make more money.

When I did check in the woman at the front desk tried to charge me for 5 night resort fee when I only paid for 4 nights through price line. I had to correct her by showing her my price line paperwork.

I used cash for $100 refundable incidental deposit and the 3 night resort fee which was slightly under $60.

They tried to put me in a handicapped room (don't know why) but I requested a regular room instead.

During check in if you don't correct these people early they will double charge you or give you a terrible room. I still ended up with a really bad room.

The room I had was in the basement the window view was an outside wall. The bathtub was clogged with hair an green slimy stuff. I tried to pour bleach in it to unclog it but that did not work. The bathroom sink had hair in it. The carpet looked old dingy and dirty.

The entire room reeked of cigarette smoke.

The buffet was bad.....for some reason it looked like the food had been sitting out all day without being stirred or freshened up or replace and it was not cheap.  Dinner cost $12. 

I didn't complain to management about my experience at the hotel I didn't think they would do anything about it......according to the other reviews I read.

It's a cheap ran down smelly hotel.....at least I wasn't double charged. It's not the maid fault that the rooms are ran down.</text></sentence><sentence id="1489"><text>The food there is really good. Service was not that great but not terrible either. They have 1,000,000 TVs for watching sports.  the place itself is really big great for big crowds.</text></sentence><sentence id="1490"><text>Food is so good! They have a new menu out with new pasta dishes and pizza's. Service is great they deliver also. Their food is like having a restaurant like olive garden deliver to you. The average delivery time for them is about 35 minutes pick up is 12 minutes.</text></sentence><sentence id="1491"><text>This place is wonderful I had my wedding reception there in the basement VIP section. Service was great food is very decently priced. Wednesday night drinks are only 1 bucks</text></sentence><sentence id="1492"><text>I go there probably 2 or 3 * a week for the last year and nothing's really changed. Monday night is the best night to go beer is 2 dollars and mixed drinks are 2.50. Other than Monday they are very expensive for the location and the service you receive. They have 1 or 2 great bartenders and the rest are either drunk on the job or too busy caring on conversations with their friends to get you a beer. They do have a great setup for watching sports and a lot of space. Food is pretty decent too and fairly priced. To be a mom and pops bar it's pretty decent. On Monday night thats the night to go good crowd too</text></sentence><sentence id="1493"><text>If I could leave stars blank I would!!!! This place was gross, don't get me wrong great server n food was good for bar food. But after finding a fruit fly in a beer I was grossed out. I asked for the beer to be removed from my tab, the manager would not allow it. she made us pay for it!!! I don't complain much as my perffesion is a general manager in the food industry. We even killed two more at our table before she came to speak to us. Her excuse was that it's the end of summer and this happens. TODAY IS DECEMBER 5TH in Ohio.  never been so offended in intellegence and sheer customer service. Will never go back. They gave me a cup of bugs and told me to deal with it wow.</text></sentence><sentence id="1494"><text>This place is great all beer and mixed drinks are only 2 dollars. Inside the place is huge and every Friday and Saturday they are packed. They play good music and the servers are really fast. Only problem I have and I warn you be careful if you pay with your credit card they make mistakes sometimes and overcharge. The other night my tab was 18 dollars but the next day when I check my bank account there were 2 charges from them. Other than that great place to hang out friendly people.</text></sentence><sentence id="1495"><text>This restaurant was very classy. Me and my wife brought a bottle of wine a appetizer and 2 dinners and the bill was only 62 bucks. The food was amazing so much flavor!! The staff was very polite and fast.</text></sentence><sentence id="1496"><text>Me and my 5 year old son stopped at this place for lunch. First time we have ever been there. I walk in immediately start looking at the menu on the wall. Young lady asked me what I liked was very helpful. I brought two corn beef sandwiches. I noticed that they had chairs where you can sit down, so me and my son sat down and waited on our food. When we received the food I figured hey let's just stay here and eat. I started to pull my food out to give my son his sandwich and a rude Nigerian or Jamaican guy! So not politely told me how there's a sign by the door stating if its pick up you must leave. Then after embarrassing me in front of the entire restaurant he proceeded to yell out to a crew member put a bigger sign up.  I'm pretty shocked at the way the customer service in this restaurant. Most restaurants would have let something as simple as me deciding to change my mind from pick up to dine in GO. Especially when I spent about $20 on two sandwiches. pretty sure I won't ever go back there again. Besides they gave me a cold cornbeef sandwich. The Swiss cheese was not even melted, and the worst part about it all they don't put mustard on the sandwich. It could have been handled better. At least offer me the option to pay the Dollar to dine instead of just throwing me out.</text></sentence><sentence id="1497"><text>I think this place is great all around. I like the location in north Olmsted better because it's bigger and there's a more attentive larger staff as well. But who can argue with 2 dollar drinks and decent service.

But the place is so nice you'll feel like 1 burger will cost you 20 dollars but it's only McDonald's</text></sentence><sentence id="1499"><text>This place is pretty cool good service. A little pricey but not that bad. Great outdoor patio set up for the summer. Worth going to and they have daily specials.</text></sentence><sentence id="1500"><text>His show in Paris Casino isn't worth its high price.  I paid for it and was disappointed from the moment that I walked into the venue, which was about the size of a large conference.  It's a cheap production and should have been priced in line with other hynotist shows.  Go see the video next the venue to see the show's highlights but don't expect more from his show.  You can expect boobs (on video), raunchy expletives, and simulated sex.</text></sentence><sentence id="1501"><text>I was here before an event at the arena and had a blast.  The Beer Cheese Dip was the BEST I have had in years.  The staff was fast and efficient.  I will stop here again the next time I am in town.  Overall, the section was outstanding.  Prices were low.</text></sentence><sentence id="1502"><text>Like a few reviewers before, I'm somewhat conflicted on how I feel about this place. It's a great addition to those who live in the SW side of town, and they do have tasty pastries. I guess I'm biased because I had really high expectations on coming here from all the reviews, and it's been in my bookmarks for some time now. It's clean, and good compared to other asian pastry shops here in town, but if you ever travel outside of Vegas, you'll see that there are places that can execute the balance of flavors a little better. If I could give it 3.5, I would. We tried the coffee jelly, tiramisu, and green tea cream puff. They're all fine, but I didn't finish any of them, which is unusual for me. Even though I'm only giving it 3 stars for now, I do encourage you to give it a try to taste something different here in Vegas!</text></sentence><sentence id="1503"><text>Quality of the sushi and food is good.  Didn't care much for the rice - it was a little hard.  The server was nice, but the place got really busy, and I felt like we waited around an awful lot.  Then later on the place smelled like something was burning. Not sure if I'd come back again for lunch, because if you have plans after - you won't make your schedule. Maybe ok for dinner?</text></sentence><sentence id="1504"><text>It's funny, another yelper mentioned a great ambiance - but I guess it's not to my taste. I don't need silence when eating my ramen, but the music was way too loud. It's not really enjoyable when you server has to yell at you, and you have to yell back for them to hear you. To make matters worse, there was awkwardness at the communal table between the random couples (yes I've sat at communal tables before without issue). Thank goodness the food was better than I expected! If it was just based on food, I'd have given it 4/4.5 stars.</text></sentence><sentence id="1505"><text>We enjoyed an incredible dinner here tonight - having dined at Michelin star rated chef's restaurants in Tokyo, Japan, I can assure you - this is the real deal!  You get to enjoy an artfully presented, well balanced tasting menu that leaves you full, but not stuffed.  Truly a great experience, and one not to be missed!! :)</text></sentence><sentence id="1506"><text>Enjoyable happy hour menu - it was a great way to try everything! We will be back again, and are getting the truffle edamame and black cod lettuce wrap again for sure :)
...so I made the cardinal mistake of posting before I finished my meal with dessert - the green tea tiramisu was amazing!  I'm a big fan of the milk tea ice cream too. Also, I was really impressed by how knowledgable our server was about the menu. She described everything perfectly. And you always have to appreciate it when the chef takes the time to come out of the kitchen to touch (greet) every table!</text></sentence><sentence id="1507"><text>Dined there last night with friends, and while the food would definitely merit a 5 out of 5 stars, the service was probably one of the worst I've had. I understand they were very busy, and had a lot of things going on (large party in the other room), large parties in the main room - but there's a way to be busy, and gracious, without so much...tension? It was outright awkward. One person in the party didn't get their food, then another guest was accused of taking that dish - but I guess the server didn't punch in the order correctly for the ticket? It was just weird and uncomfortable. Another guest asked for help in getting drinks ordered, and no one would respond. I'd have typically given it 1 star, but hopefully I came here on an atypical night, and would like to give them the benefit of the doubt...or maybe suggest take-out to fellow yelpers? :)</text></sentence><sentence id="1508"><text>What a surprise! Came here from a recommendation by a friend, and it lived up to it's rep. It's got a nice, trendy, modern sort of atmosphere, and combined with tasty Thai fusion (I don't know if I'd call it 100% traditional) - it's a definite hit!  We'll be back again</text></sentence><sentence id="1509"><text>After asking a friend of mine of where to go - I took my SUV down to Island Auto for an oil change and a check engine light that was on in my car.  The owner was really nice and honest - he didn't give me the run-around or try to overcharge me.  My car was repaired well, and for a much better price than what the dealership wanted to charge me.  Will be back again!</text></sentence><sentence id="1510"><text>I have to be honest - I feel for the girls who had a poor experience at this David's Bridal...but I personally had the complete opposite experience.  I walked in one day on the spur of the moment with my fianc&#233;, and made an appointment for later in the week (when he wouldn't be there).  When I arrived with my mom that morning, I was greeted promptly by the friendly girl at the desk.  She got basic info from me on what I was looking for/budget/etc.  We then were led to the fitting area with my consultant, Tatiana.  After reviewing what I was looking for, she started to pull a few dresses at a time for me to try on.  She took the time to ask me what I liked and didn't like from each of my dresses.  She was really sweet, professional, and genuine.  I told myself I wasn't going to buy a dress at my first appointment ever...but after 3 hours of trying on dresses, and trying my favorites back on a second time...I selected the gown of my dreams!  Not only was I never rushed, or ever made to feel like I was just a sale, my consultant Tatiana made me feel like an instant friend for the day.  She didn't try to blow through my budget and bring me dresses that were on the high end of my budget - she really did try her best to make me feel amazing and beautiful.  I ended up picking a dress that wasn't even what I had in mind - and I'm so glad for it!  The manager was also very polite and my mom and I were happy she took the time to introduce herself to us.  Yes the store had other brides, and yes there were others looking in the mirrors, and yes my consultant had to split her time...but it's such an exciting moment - I didn't realize how much time was passing, and it took some pressure off to not have her there standing by me the whole time, allowing me to talk to my mom about each dress.  As someone who also works in guest service, I can tell you Tatiana was great at multi-tasking - she gave me all the time I needed, and when she was working with me, she had her focus completely on me.  When I came back to the store a few weeks later to pick up my ordered sash, I had another great experience!  The lady at the desk this time also greeted me, and helped me find the headpieces (since I now wanted to try them on too)!  A consultant who was in the area was really kind, and he asked me if I needed help, and offered suggestions for what I was looking for.  When I finally made my way to the counter an pick up what I was actually there to get (my order), the manager and consultant there were both great...I am honestly blown away with it all, because I know it's rare to find that level of incredible service from a large chain.  Thank you, Tatiana, and the whole crew at this David's Bridal location!  I'll be sure to come back and get all my bridesmaid dresses / accessories very soon.  :)</text></sentence><sentence id="1511"><text>My husband and I went there last night once we landed in las vegas, and I am happy we did. The slices are huge, and delicious. 

I did however, just get the basic cheese pizza.. kind of hard to screw up. But I have no complaints.

I will definitely be going back for another slice before I go home.</text></sentence><sentence id="1512"><text>I went here for lunch today and it was great. I first walked by the place yesterday and couldn't stop thinking how good it probably is.. and turns out, I was correct.  

I got a strawberry margarita, guacamole,  and beef burrito.  The drink was strong,  guac was fresh, and the shredded beef burrito was so flavourful and filling. I was only able to eat about half of it. 

The service was awesome, it was happy hour and our waiter was very attentive with our drinks and the food was out within 15 mins. 

I would recommend this place to any Mexican food lovers. Mmmm.</text></sentence><sentence id="1513"><text>Not only was my vehicle towed for no explicable reason, but attaining it was an extremely frustrating situation. Their website states that they are open DAILY from 8 am to 6:30 pm. Upon calling them, the rude woman on the telephone told me that they had indeed closed at 12 pm that day, but for an extra 40$ fee they could have a driver come release my vehicle to me in no less than 45 mins. Let's just say I've been waiting for over 2 hours, have called them several times and have still not gotten my vehicle. I'm extremely dissatisfied with their poor customer service and value for the time of others.</text></sentence><sentence id="1514"><text>When we first arrived here, I thought this place would be a 5 star experience. Their bacon board and apple pie moonshine is out of this world.

After we had the bacon board, my husband and I took our server's suggestion and ordered their short ribs, which our server said were phenomenal. The short ribs come with fried coleslaw and we asked the server if we could sub asparagus and not get the fried coleslaw. So, the short ribs and asparagus come out. The short ribs were tough, small, and didn't have much flavor.

Then, when our bill came we were charged the full amount of the short ribs and coleslaw, and an additional $4 for our asparagus, which clearly shows that it's $4 on it's own. So, why did we have to pay full price to sub them and then not get a side that was supposed to come with our meal? So, we basically paid full price to not receive a side, and paid an extra four dollars for asparagus that would have been $4 regardless if it was subbed or not. 

We also experienced some issues splitting our bill and my husband and I were charged $30 more than we were supposed to be, even after telling our server that some of the items on our receipt weren't ours before she swiped our card. We were still overcharged and had to cancel one tab, but still be recharged for the other.

This place started out a wonderful experience but it seemed to get worse and worse as the night when on.

I will definitely go back, but only for the bacon board and moonshine, not the entrees.</text></sentence><sentence id="1515"><text>Big 2 Toyota is one of the worst auto dealers in Arizona. If you want a new car, save yourself time and money by going to Power Toyota in Tempe. A year ago my boyfriend and I bought a brand new four runner from Big 2. They seemed nice when we were there but our payments were outrageous. A year later we decided we needed to trade our vehicle in because the payments were so high. We went to Power and they asked for our contract. We gave them all our paperwork Big 2 had given us and came to find out they never gave us a copy of the contract. They also told us our payments were so high because almost $8,000 of stuff was added on to our contract that we didn't need. They even added a life insurance policy for over 3,000...guess what...I was 21 at that time and my bf was 24. We had no idea that we had agreed to all that stuff and felt so stupid that we let them take advantage of us. Power Toyota pulled some major strings to help us because we had so much negative equity. Now, Big 2 owes us a lot of money in cancellation refunds and when I called to find out the status of our refund they said they'd call me back and never did. I even left a voicemail for the finance director, Brian, and never heard from him. My boyfriend went through the same thing. Today, after pulling some strings we finally got them to call us back and we find out they lost our paperwork. Horrible business full of deceitful, uncaring, unprofessional people. Toyota is a wonderful company and Big 2 completely hurts their image. Once I get my refund I will never do business with them again and tell all my friends and family to avoid them and go to Power where they are not looked at as a number but as a person.</text></sentence><sentence id="1516"><text>We had this place for the first time tonight.

From the planning of the ceremony to the initial consultation at the venue to the actual ceremony to the photo viewing appointment after the ceremony...we were very, very happy with everything!!  Yvette Prather was our wedding coordinator and the first person we had contacted about booking our wedding there. She was very helpful with getting all of my questions answered and addressing all of the concerns that I had. Our package included a luxury sedan picking us up from our hotel and taking us to get our marriage license and then to the initial consultation at the venue. The driver of the luxury sedan was awesome and super sweet...she even gave us a card to congratulate us on the wedding. Very thoughtful!! Once we got to the venue to see it for the first time and have the consultation, we worked with Danielle. She was amazing!! She was very friendly and answered all of the questions that we had. We were also very happy with the Terrace!! I could see where it would be a little small for people who have a lot of guests. For our wedding, it was just my husband and I and the venue could not be more perfect. We had another luxury sedan driver that dropped us off for brunch after the consultation, and he was awesome too!! Our package also included a limo driver to take us to and from the ceremony, and that limo driver was amazing and very nice and friendly as well. A few minutes after we arrived for our ceremony, they brought us upstairs to wait in the bridal suite. We probably stayed in there for 30 minutes or so before our ceremony started. It was so nice that we got to stay in there before the ceremony because they do have other weddings going on at the same time and it made us feel special and like it was just our day. While we were waiting in the bridal suite, we met Reverend Garcia, who was very nice and sweet and just all around awesome. We also had several pictures taken in the bridal suite, and our photographer was amazing and did a wonderful job. Our ceremony went off without a hitch. We chose 2 songs to play when I walked down the aisle and then when we walked out and that made it very sentimental and special. We were also each able to recite our own vows, which made it even more personal. I had chosen to have the rose petals sprinkled down the aisle as well and was very happy with that decision as it turned out looking great. All in all, the venue was spectacular!! We had a 9:30 PM ceremony and it just turned out so lovely at that time because the gazebo is lit up and looks beautiful. We were very, very pleased with the venue!! We had some friends and family members who watched the online live streaming of our ceremony back home, and they said that it turned out great and they felt like they were able to join in on our special day. After the ceremony, we had more pictures taken (which pretty much all turned out awesome by the way), and then we checked out by giving them the address to mail our marriage certificate to. After the ceremony, our limo driver dropped us off at Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere, and he was just as kind as could be. We had our photo viewing appointment back at Vegas Weddings the morning after our ceremony. At that appointment (less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended), we were able to view a wedding slideshow of pictures that they had edited. We absolutely fell in love with the majority of the pictures that they had taken and ended up just purchasing our entire photo package at that time. The entire package is kind of pricy, but it is only a fraction of what we would have paid a photographer back home if we had had a "traditional" ceremony. They were able to give us a CD copy of our wedding slideshow, a DVD copy of our wedding video, and a CD copy of all of our wedding pictures in color, sepia, black and white, and thumbnail versions in hand at the end of that appointment...which means that we received all of that less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended. And the pictures were high quality and turned out so beautiful!! I was floored!! Especially when I hear of so many people complaining that they have not received their wedding photos a month or more after their wedding. I was very blown away that they had everything done and ready to go that quickly!! It was awesome!! And the quality of our wedding video was amazing too...it turned out so well!! Everyone that we worked with through Vegas Weddings was very friendly, helpful, and dedicated to making our wedding experience there as special for us as possible. We would recommend for anyone considering getting married in Vegas to get married at Vegas Weddings!!!! I will even be telling people who are engaged and not sure of what they want their wedding to be like yet to go to Vegas just to get married at Vegas Weddings!! It is an awesome place!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1521"><text>We were recommended to Cashman through our wedding venue Emerald at Queensridge and it's no wonder they recommend them!

They truly saw the vision I wanted for my wedding and we're always available to help with any questions I had! I worked mostly with Kathryn for my payments/money stuff (amazing, always got back to me super fast) and Moe who did the setup/delivery of the flowers (so sweet and cool, felt like we had been friends forever) would highly recommend them for anything needing flowers in the Vegas area!</text></sentence><sentence id="1524"><text>I cannot say enough amazing things about EAQ! We had our December 8, 2013 wedding here and from the first time we walked through the door to check out the venue to a year and a half later when said our "I Do's" nothing was left undone! They are so organized and efficient and know the wedding biz inside and out! Never once was I given a "I don't know" or a "we can't do that"...they will find the answer or a way no matter what and they do it always with a smile! They evening of my wedding, I felt like I was the only bride that had ever lived! They truly catered to my needs as well as my guests!

This restaurant is another product of a bad trend happening in Toronto. A mediocre restaurant that somehow gets great reviews from pretentious rags such as Toronto Life, Globe and Mail, etc. and the virulent contagion spreads to the minds of every subsequent reviewer and patron of said 'trendy' locale.

The food at this restaurant is just OK. It deserves no better than 2/5 stars. My partner and I eat out a lot and this might be the most overhyped restaurant we've tried in the past 24 months. Avoid.</text></sentence><sentence id="1532"><text>This place is sooooo good! The service has always been very good and the food is always on point!

The first few times the service has been a bit slow and lacking personality. However I took my wife with me this last visit and there was a bar tender with a broken foot who had us almost in tears from laughing so hard. There were a few older gentlemen a few seats down from us and she was joking with them and chatting about their family and her kids. This bar now seems to be more of a local place to hang out with good company rather than a typical sports bar that you just go to from time to time.  
If there were a better selection of craft beers the firehouse would have 5 stars easily!  Not even a decent IPA! The bartender was knowledgeable about beer however the bar had nothing good to offer. 
 We were  also introduced to the eli steak which was delicious! It is not on the menu, which makes no sense to us but we will be back for it!</text></sentence><sentence id="1534"><text>All four of my daughters have played here for years.

Instructor proceeded to belittle my daughter and wife by insinuating we were trying to get something for free by staying for second class.  I called in and advised them of this horrible situation and awful customer service. They DID NOT show compassion towards my issue or offer an apology for THEIR misunderstanding.I have been waiting for this company to show up on Yelp since this incident so that I can warn all of the unsuspecting people about this business.

I only spend about 1 day a week in the home office.  In 1.5 years, the synthetic leather in the chair totally fell apart.  Conveniently the warranty was only 1 year.  Structube personnel at this location and the head office refused to do anything even after repeated attempts at contacting them.  I would've expected a $400 chair to last at least ten years when used only once a week.  My previous $80 Staples chair lasted more than 8 years.

Structube: poor quality expensive furniture - although it is good looking - just don't expect it to last.</text></sentence><sentence id="1547"><text>The food is amazing.  It's made with love.  I have tried almost all veggie and sea food dishes, and all absolutely amazing.

You will always get good service and good food.  Ignore bad reviews based on service.  Enjoy :)</text></sentence><sentence id="1548"><text>My most favourite Italian restuarant in the Vaughan area - and this area is full of Italian restaurant.  This is definitely not a typical Italian though - they have eastern twists in various dishes - which make it different in a great way.  The dishes are simply more flavourful.  I love the various pasta sauces and seasoning that use saffron.  The chicken pastas, steak pastas and seafood pastas are all awesome.  I am not a big steak person and have also heard that their steaks are not their strong point.  The two poutines are really great as well - which again also are different from regular poutines as they have hints of eastern flavours.  Awesome restaurant.  If you feel like having Italian, and want to try something different, this is definitely the place.</text></sentence><sentence id="1549"><text>Bamiyan kebab has the best kebab options period.  Their various chicken and beef kebabs are all amazing.  It's really good to go with a bunch of people that you can try all the kebabs.

Highly recommended.  It's also great for people who are New to different ethnic foods as this is relatively mild and you can add as much spice as you want on the side as needed.  :)</text></sentence><sentence id="1550"><text>This is one of the best Indian restaurants in Brampton.  Everything always tastes super fresh and super tasty.  Quality is seriously lacking in a lot of Bramton Indian restaurants but that's not an issue here everything is high-quality.

The notable mentions are Achari paneer, chili paneer, fish tikka, gajar halwa, chat papri and Channa bhatura.   I've been going here for years - highly recommended :)

 I only wish they had halal chicken... so I could try the chicken dishes too.</text></sentence><sentence id="1551"><text>My favourite Pakistani/Indian restaurant in GTA.

They have the best Bihari Kabab, Peshawari Kabab, Karahi dishes and over all dishes I've tried (which is almost all of them) are super delicious and mouth watering.  It's a little small, so, it's always a good idea to call and make sure they are not busy before going - as it's quite popular and there is often a wait, especially on weekends.

She came across wonderfully in my initial meeting with her but things quickly went downhill. She showed up at my wedding with a friend that she claimed was her second photographer but I don't think that friend took any pictures. My bridesmaids later told me that Leah was saying she didn't even want to be there...I paid her plenty of money to be there! I had to beg her for pictures after a few months and then got about 100 less than what was promised in the contract. Oh and no reception pictures! I don't have a single picture of me dancing with my husband or father. I asked her about this and she came up with excuse after excuse. Finally after 8 months and the threat of a lawsuit she admitted she didn't have any pictures from the reception. Leah has changed her company name so many times (I'm sure due the bad reviews) and it makes me so mad that she's still out there duping people.

The menu is very vast (almost too vast at points though) so you are bound to find something that suits your fancy. 2. The atmosphere is great - crowded but not too crowded, cool artwork on the walls, awesome bar with a giant salt water fish tank that spans the front wall, great outdoor seating by the fountain if that suits your fancy. 3. The food is YUM (the Bento box is my favorite as you get a little of everything, burger and sushi). 4. Love that when you enter the bathroom the background "music" is 3 voice where one is a sentence in English, one in Redneck and one in Japanese!  5. The service has always been top notch! 6. They have a combination burger and sushi option that is called Burgushi...novel ideal! 

Biggest draw back to me is that there is ALWAYS a wait and reservations are hard to come by unless you make then well in advance. Also, not a fan of no drink specials on the weekend.  

Overall, a fun place that I will continue to support.</text></sentence><sentence id="1563"><text>Great food....one of the best burgers in Charlotte. Spuds are good and a very generous portion.

We split the tofu tod for an appetizer. Panko coated and fried tofu with a crazy good sweet/spice dipping sauce. The tofu was well seasoned (its easy for fried things to go bland and this didn't) and had great texture. 

I had chicken pad thai. For $13 it was a generous portion. It came out piping hot and with a perfect level of spice (I requested on the mild side of medium, which isn't easy to nail).

I also tried my husband's massaman curry with chicken, sweet potato, and peanut. It was phenomenal, really rich from coconut milk with great flavor and heat. 

The service here wasn't bad, but they're definitely still learning. Our waitress mentioned that her brother opened the restaurant with his wife, and I'm happy to support a family business while they sort out the kinks. 

I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood and will routinely be slammed.

This used to be my favorite nail salon, but since the new owners took over it has gone downhill. The customer service is horrible, and their services are shoddy at best. It took a total of 7 minutes for my pedicure from start to finish....i was cut twice on my cuticles, no callus treatment, and no massage.

I first tried Impact Boot Camp with a Groupon Special.  I knew I needed a change from my regular boring work outs at the gym.  It seemed like I was just going through the motions and not really seeing any success.  I liked the trial so much I ended up joining as a member.  There are 3 instructors, all with their own unique style which makes it a nice change and fun to work out.  The workouts are always different and challenging.  The best part to me is all I have to do is show up and give it my all, they have the workout all planned for me, no thinking involved of what do I have to do next.  After a few months of eating right and doing Impact Boot Camp for about 4 days a week I have lost 10.5 lbs and almost 6% body fat.  I'm very pleased with my results and look forward to continuing with Impact Boot Camp for even more improvements.</text></sentence><sentence id="1576"><text>I went to the cafe/bar at the pool.

My weary tummy has not had anything substantial all day, and having read the best of the best about the amazing La Tolteca, I decided to let me feet hit the street &amp; check out this local flor in the rough.  Well, I have to say the reviews are all TRUTH.  
The green enchilada's were my choice as I've not ever been huge fan of the red sauce, in addition to a full range of all that one could feast your immediate appetite too, there is also fresh tortillas, candy, the bakery which is a temptation I did avoid (thank you P90X) and yes, I did say it, the temptation is the BAKERY,  the smells hit your nose before you even step in, yeast, sugar and spices, La Raza!  
Enjoy your time, don't rush, I wandered around and grabbed my favorite Fanta to connect the true flavors of home, Cali and my youth, thanks for the great time La Tolteca, and you'd better be sure that I'll be stopping in again with re-inforcements.   
Gracias &amp; Happy Eating</text></sentence><sentence id="1588"><text>Came for dinner and so unbelievably DISAPPOINTED!! Ordered Salmon which was jerky not a filet.

Unless it's the only thing open and we're dying of hunger, maybe there's a slight chance. And if it weren't for the voucher we got, this restaurant ain't in our list to try when in Vegas, but it was a win-win, good opportunity to try since it's free dinner (with exceptions of: dessert, alcohol, tax, and gratuity)!

We were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed. Our server named Juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should I say was too busy  favoring the group before us. It made it more noticeable after we've eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room. But what the hell, they all does the same, but to be determined to bring quality service, which I felt Juan didn't deliver well. 

I had Brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh! Bucca di Beppo or Bravo's, all located in Hawaii probably could have done a better version. It's pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels (which the only thing I liked), shrimp, and salmon fish that's super untasty! My husband had Surf &amp; Turf Rodizio with "unlimited" meat serving and my in-laws had Grilled Salmon and Skirt Steak (not part of this review) while my child had Loaded Cheese Fries (bacon, cheese, sour cream all OTS because we have a picky eater). 

Going back to my husband's food that didn't impress me at all, even if there's different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it, due to lack of consistency. They seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys. Not a big fan of dead carcass (I'm a wannabe plant based dieter), so I can't really attest how good it was for my husband, but I can tell it didn't really pass to his liking the meat choices and service. 

To end the night, we had some confusion with our server Juan. I should have mentioned this beforehand and the server should've done the same with warning us with water charge per person. Like who does that? I guess only Pampas Brazilian Grille! Or the voucher could've printed it too with other exceptions. Plus, the way Juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order! Instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end, he customized the receipt like they're trying to manipulate something. And call me stingy or whatever, but I didn't like the force tipping impression! That's why it's called a tip because it's up to the guest if they think it was well-deserved. At that case, he obviously didn't earn the whole 15% because I had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husband's and child's water just so I can go on with my dinner. Plus it's not even ice cold! They charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle. There was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groups.

Giving it two stars only because it was "free" dinner and experiencing the meat serving at a lackluster manner! Go get that voucher as a VISA card instead!</text></sentence><sentence id="1591"><text>EXCELLENT!!   The smoked salmon app was some of the best I have ever had!

The crab cake was also done perfectly with huge lumps of crab meat and little filler. Lastly, the mashed potatoes were thick and very flavorful.

Chicken was average and the waffle was bland and hard like a brick. I absolutely hated the syrup. 

Hush puppies were the best thing we ordered and were prob the best I've had since moving here 

Bacon jelly biscuit was also good but I wouldn't order it again 

Overall it's a fun spot with average food but we will go back  at some point to try it again.</text></sentence><sentence id="1593"><text>Not good at all. I had the tuna tacos and my wife had the bacon, shrimp tacos. Both were tasteless. The rice was so dry it was inedible and the black beans were straight out of a can.  

The service was slow and non existent. We asked for lemons for water twice, refill of salsa that never came, another beer which also never came, and they allow smoking outside in the patio!!  No one wants to sit beside a cigarette during dinner. When we asked about the state law they said they allow people to smoke on the patio anyway. 

$45 for 2 crappy meals and a beer! We will not be back!</text></sentence><sentence id="1594"><text>This was a weird dining experience.  The atmosphere is like a casual dining spot but the prices we high for the offerings. My wife and I spent almost $80 on 1 small app, 1 dessert and 2 entrees. No drinks.  Both entrees were wrong as if they ran out of food and were plating dishes on the fly with whatever they had. Nothing we ordered came out correct except the water. 

App:  Deviled eggs - good flavor in the filling but the whites were extremely rubbery. 

Entree 1 : Sea bass topped with crab / veg medley.  The Sea bass was good except it didn't come with anything that it was advertised on the menu. It came with fried mashed potatoes instead of the veggies , no crab meat, and had pesto sauce on it. I actually asked for the menu and pointed to what I thought I was getting. They brought my plate back and there was literally about 1/4 of an oz of crab meat. My wife and I just chuckled. 

Entree 2 : salmon and cheesy mashed. Salmon was great, but came with veggies instead of mashed.  Come to find out they ran out of mashed potatoes and we were stuck wth the veggies.  Who runs out of a main side dish at 6:30p?! 

Dessert: PB brownie cheesecake. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND CALORIES! Huge piece but bland and tasted kinda stale. Was also supposed to be topped with Pb cups. It wasn't. By this time we were fed up and just asked for the check.   We have NEVER not finished a dessert. We took it home and even the kids thought it was bad. 

Service: average at best. Everyone had super awkward personalities and it was painful to have a conversation. Our waitress seemed to be frustrated with everything. She would ask us how we are doing and then walk away while we were answering. We waited for silverware on 2 different occasions.   

To top it off the UPS driver wheels in 10 giant boxes right beside our table to unload in the kitchen.  

Like I said, it was a strange experience.</text></sentence><sentence id="1595"><text>Really cool place and the kids enjoyed customizing their pops.  Prices aren't bad for a niche shop and the pops were very good.

I stayed here for 1 night with a promotional rate of $85 plus tax in December 2009, and ended up paying $200 [basically their normal rate].  It wasn't even a full night, we checked in at like 8:30pm close to 9pm, and checked out earlier than 10am to make it to the famous Paris Brunch, before head on over to our Time Share.  That's like 13 hours, including sleep and walking the strip for 5 hours.

Don't get me wrong with this, it's a very beautiful and impressive property, but what happened after I left, can't be forgiven.  It's appalling, and I feel like I've been personally violated by the whole ordeal.

When my Credit Card Bill came, I noticed 2 charges from "Mandalay Bay".  I called to find out what the second charge was about and found out that I had apparently been charged over $100 for things from the private bar.   

I travel a lot, and know better than to touch anything in the overpriced bar, when there's the same exact stuff down stairs for much cheaper.  When I asked for a receipt of the itemized charges to be emailed to me.  I never received it.  I called twice to have it emailed, and twice they said they'd do it, and they wouldn't, so I disputed the charge through my Credit Card company.

30 days later, my Credit card was able to receive a copy of the itemized list and below were the items they pretty much made up out of thin air.  

--- half of this stuff, i don't even know what it is.  A "CD?"  what the heck.  What would i play it in?  Who plays a CD in Vegas?   I stayed in the room with brothers and sisters, what would I do with a "Love Kit".   

The only thing I could think of would be the personnel taking everything before tidying up the room, and blaming it on me....how would you dispute that?

4 bottles of Fiji water ($5)
1 Pringles Sour cream ($5)
2 Orange Juice ($4)
1 CD ($10)
1 Travel Kit ($15)
1 Love Kit ($30)
2 Cranberry Juice ($4)

In the end I couldn't do anything because they had my credit card on file for "incidental" charges. -- something that's industry standard, but to Arbitrarily charge for everything that was in the room, even if it wasn't used is absolutely NOT standard at all.  It's Shady!

I come to Vegas a lot and have stayed in a good handful of hotels on the strip and have never had any other Hotel chain do this.    From the budget friendly Imperial Palace, to even their very own newest 5 star, the Aria hotel, and not ONCE did any of them try this nonsense.  

For the many conferences and personal visits to Vegas I shall make, in the future, I will never, ever stay at the Mandalay or TheHotel again.  It's managed by Shady people.</text></sentence><sentence id="1602"><text>This has been the worst experience I have ever received at a business establishment. So much so that I feel obligated in writing my first Yelp review in the five years since I've been a member.. 

This is how the story goes:

My girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8/26 to watch the Mayweather/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get "unexpectedly" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd. 

At this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. 

So we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow. 

So then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.

It's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone. 

So officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins.....
*This review will be updated as soon as I hear back from someone.*

NOTE: This entire situation has been a mess, and if the owners/leaders of this establishment had any sense of integrity towards their patrons, they would make this right!</text></sentence><sentence id="1603"><text>I'd like to add to Steven's abundance of great reviews!!

I was happy to find this place. Nice older couple that own it.</text></sentence><sentence id="1608"><text>I can not recommend this bookstore. I have been a book reader all my life. In fact, when I was growing up my parents had an independent bookstore. I am someone that is always buying books. Shortly before Christmas I drove to The Bookshop intending on buying books as Christmas Gifts. I do not smoke in my car and wait until I get somewhere to light up outside. While having my cigarette I was looking through the windows of "The Bookshop" prior to entering. The store was empty of customers as usual. A man inside saw me looking at the merchandise through the windows and in a most obnoxious voice came out and told me not to smoke in front of his store.  His arrogant manner and tone of voice implied that I was some sort of vagrant because I was a smoker. I told him "You just lost a customer." Every time I go past there to go to Dick's Hideaway to eat I never see anybody in his book store.  In fact, the other merchants in that strip plaza say they do not know how The Bookshop pays its rent as they never see anybody in there.  I might also add that while looking in the windows I noticed a sign inside the book store that said "Pets Welcome."  Like many Americans I am extremely allergic to dog and cat hair and do not think they should be allowed inside retail businesses unless they are seeing eye dogs.  The Bookshop owners are not considerate of potential customers.</text></sentence><sentence id="1609"><text>The portions are very generous - there is definitely enough to take home for a second dinner.</text></sentence><sentence id="1610"><text>Excellent, Excellent facility.  I have had several procedures done here and have been absolutely pleased with everything.  The overall experience from the front desk to Dr. Hall, to Evelyn the aesthetician has been wonderful.  Everyone is friendly, the facility is state of the art and the results are AMAZING.

I spend a lot of time in the sun and have experienced severe sun damage, primarily the ugly brown sun spots that connect and take over your skin!  After consultations regarding what I hoped to achieve I was given suggestions on what would work best for my skin.  This was done at first with Shannon.  She is terrific!  Very down to earth and funny. This really puts you at ease as you discuss procedures and financials; also important, given that these procedures are obvious luxuries for most people .  There is no high pressure sales and they always point you to promotions that might be coming up and how to get the most bang for your buck. 

Evelyn, the aesthetician is wonderful.  Very friendly, puts you at ease and really knows her business.   As I stated, I do have a lot of sun damage that has reared its ugly head in middle age. I will need to have more treatments done, but due to my outside activity I have to schedule it around times I will be inside a lot (summer).  After 3 treatments, there is a noticeable difference in my skin.  Many of the very prominent dark brown spots are completely gone off of my face and my chest area is almost completely clear!  It truly takes years off of your skin; which shouldn't be important but it is!

I have also had lipo on my previous  "baby" region. I'm of average height and weight but after children even diet and exercise couldn't get rid of that belly bump.  The results are amazing, no more pooch or "jiggly" area.  Do I look 20 again?  No, but that's not the purpose.  My interaction with Dr. Hall from the consultation to the actual procedure was excellent.  He gives you a realistic view of what you can achieve with the procedure. No false promises. He said that I had enough elasticity in my skin that it would shrink back after the procedure and he was absolutely correct.   He is kind and has an excellent bedside manner that is all but forgotten in today's world.  

I am very pleased with all the results and will be returning here for future laser resurfacing.  I recommend this facility to everyone.</text></sentence><sentence id="1611"><text>We were looking for an older but reliable vehicle for our son.  We had looked at dealerships but we wanted to pay cash and most dealerships just don't carry older vehicles for a cash price with any type of warranty.   We told the salesperson what we were looking for and the price range and he suggested 2 vehicles that fit our needs. The salesperson was pleasant to work with and we were able to get the vehicle out the door for the price we needed and the paperwork process was very quick.  

Within the 15 day warranty period we did have an issue with the vehicle.  However, we contacted the dealership and worked with Patrick.  He was very helpful and the problem was corrected in an acceptable amount of time.  He returned calls quickly and worked with us to resolve the issue. 

Overall, we have been very pleased with the purchase.   Customer service is incredibly important; especially when issues arise.  This business met all of our expectations.</text></sentence><sentence id="1612"><text>Dr. Guyette really is a Top Doc. An immediate family member recently had to have a skin cancer removed.  Everything was explained prior to the appointment (procedure, insurance, etc.). There are no long waits once you arrive for your appointment and everyone is friendly and courteous.  You are not rushed through appointments and he answers ALL of your questions without making you feel like you are on the clock.

Dr. Guyette is very caring and shows a great deal of compassion as he performs the procedure.  As noted previously, by other patients, he personally calls you to see how you are doing after surgery; this really is unheard of these days.  After receiving the test results from the biopsy Dr. Guyette's diagnosis was absolutely correct and enough tissue was removed so that we didn't have to go back to have additional work done. The cancer was right below the neck area so it was highly visible.  It's completely healed and unless you are really looking or know it was there the stiches are nearly UNDETECTABLE!   Beautiful work......for anyone who may be considering any other procedures.   

As a side note, we have also been to the Scottsdale office; both facilities are lovely. Our daughter had cystic acne when she was younger.  We originally had gone to a dermatologist and didn't like the treatment that had been prescribed; a prescription that had a lot of side effects we were not willing to risk.  Long story short, we took her to Dr. Guyette's Scottsdale office and through skin treatments, approximately 3 (laser) and using the Obaji line of products her skin completely cleared!  It's been almost 9 years, she continues to use the skin regimen they suggested and her skin has remained cystic acne free.  She did have some slight scarring from the acne but thanks to the IPL treatments it really is minimal and undetectable with very little make up.

We never hesitate to recommend either facility.</text></sentence><sentence id="1613"><text>This place is clean and sanitary from what I saw; however, customer service is also very important and the interactions that I experienced was not great.  The lady that did my nails made several snips around my cuticles to the point where they are still stinging, one actually was bleeding. She was polite, but difficult to understand and not a great nail tech.  The man who did my friend's nails was beyond rude.  She needed fills and a color but after not completely understanding him and him acting like he didn't understand "fills and color" , he removed the "powder" he had put on and then because of what she needed done he told her needed to put the "powder" back on but there would be an extra charge because she had changed her mind and he had removed the "powder".  What?  We still have no idea what he was doing except charging extra.  She hadn't changed her mind he was making it more confusing than necessary.  All of this was being done with his eye rolling and heavy sighing like his customer was intruding on his day. This place is also much more expensive than other salons.   Fortunately, there are nail salons on every corner so it isn't necessary to spend hard earned money here.</text></sentence><sentence id="1614"><text>Nothing too complicated, so I thought.

The driver wouldn't let me on and told me I needed to schedule a pick up.  Called and they told me it was too short of notice so I took a cab.</text></sentence><sentence id="1615"><text>We chose Stabella based off of a recommendation from a family friend. Unfortunately our experience wasn't everything we expected it to be. The main issues that we had was that our countertop was cut into two pieces to fit together, which sounded fine. But they cut a straight line instead of the typical angled line that you see. The straight line makes it so much easier to see. AND the worst part is that the color is so off its extremely obvious to see the line. We just feel that an effort to match the colors at the line should have been made. A few minor issues is that the countertops didn't fit the walls because our walls weren't straight. Which of course isn't Stabella's problem, but the sales rep initially told us that if this happened on sight the installers would just cut the wall a little to slide the counter tops in so everything would be flush with the wall. But when the installers got there they said they couldn't do that because the line (where the two pieces were cut and were supposed to meet) wouldn't be flush. We also decided not to get a backsplash because the sales rep talked us into how "new" and "modern" looking it would be. But then when we ran into the problems with the wall not being straight we wish we had just ordered the backsplash to hide the issues in the wall. Once again, that's not Stabella's fault that our wall wasn't straight but we just wish the sales rep had been a little more realistic instead of making everything seem like roses and daisies. In the end this left us feeling dissatisfied because we expected different things based on the initial sales pitch. Going back to the line where the two pieces met and one side was much darker than the other, they told us that the granite cutters were instructed to put the darker piece in be back. So what that told me is that Stabella was 100% aware of the drastic change in color while they were cutting our granite ... And the didn't care or even think that would bother us? They just sent it out to be installed at our house anyways. They offered to have an installer come out and apply a darkening agent to the lighter side..but why wasn't this done when the granite was still in their factory being cut? It would have saved everyone a lot of trouble and things would have been done right in the first place. We declined having them come back out to apply the darkening agent because we were worried it would end up looking worse and then we'd really be screwed. Let me add that after we notified them we were declining their offer to come out and darken the countertops, we NEVER heard from them again. We NEVER at any point in the process heard an apology that we weren't 100% satisfied, they never bothered to reassure us that their work would look great after they applied the darkening agent and they'd really like to make it right...nothing. Long story short, I would never recommend Stabella and we've even gone so far as to give their name to some acquaintances and say they're who we recommend you NOT use. Stabella might get away with taking our money and leaving us dissatisfied, but we'll do our best to keep people we know from using them.</text></sentence><sentence id="1616"><text>Glass Doctor of Charlotte has replaced my mom's windshield, repair mine, and most recently replaced my husband's windshield.

My dog had developed a serious rash on his skin and wasn't eating of drinking all of the sudden.

I'm 6' tall, so when my bride was at the store choosing a dress she specifically asked the sales lady if the dress could be ordered in extra long. The lady looked in the computer and told my bride that the dress could be ordered in extra long. Great! So I go to buy my dress, and the sales associate tells me that the dress is on sale for almost half the price. Great! I was ecstatic. So I pay for the dress, and as I'm walking out the door I return to ask the date that the dress will be in. The lady goes back in the computer system and says "whoops, I accidentally did your dress as a take off the rack instead of an order." So basically, if I would have walked out of the store my dress never would have been ordered. How upsetting is that! Well, as she look in the computer system to actually place the order, she finds that the dress is discontinued in extra long. So basically, she lied to my bride when she told her that the dress could be ordered in extra long. So I'm polite and say that it's fine and I'll just order the regular length and it will just be short on me - well then they tell me that I owe an additional $50, because the regular length dress was not on sale. I asked to speak to the manager to see if she would honor the discounted price, since that is what they told me that I would be owed. And the manager was extremely rude and would not honor that discounted price. Super bad customer service. First, they lied to my bride - the dress was not available in extra long. They lied to me - they didn't order the dress, and it never would have been caught if I didn't ask them to confirm the date that it would be in. And then they wouldn't honor the lower price of the discontinued dress. Honoring the regular length dress at the extra length dress's price would have made me feel a whole lot better about the situation. They basically said "sorry, it's not available." And that's all that they would do to remedy the situation. Very disappointed!!! I will be recommending to anybody that I know who is getting married to NOT use David's Bridal. If it weren't for my anal double checking personality, I never would have asked when my dress would be in, and the dress never would have been ordered. The wedding would have been here and I would have had no dress! If you are ordering from them, I would definitely suggest double, triple checking that your dress has been ordered. Otherwise, who knows if it will ever come in.</text></sentence><sentence id="1619"><text>We called Air Source on a Thursday and were quickly able to schedule an appointment for the following Monday. Jeff arrived within the time frame that he said he would and he spent several hours looking at our unit. He found several problems and was even willing to put some temporary parts on to test it out to see if we could get by with a repair instead of a whole replacement. We finally determined our 8 year old system just needed to be replaced. We asked Jeff how much the first visit would be and he said no charge. Wow! Most places would charge hundreds of dollars for a service call visit. He ended up calling us that night with a final price for a new unit that he recommended and confirmed that everything he needed was in stock at his supply house. We scheduled the replacement for the following day. I was shocked he could get us in that fast. Once again, he arrived on time and spent several hours replacing our unit and also replacing some duct work that was too small. The final price was exactly what he quoted us with no extra surprises. Air Source will definitely be our go-to Heating and Cooling Business from now on!

I did enjoy my visit with the doctor, but the headache that their staff has caused me for the past several months will force me to never go back for another visit.

He beat out all the other prices that we had gotten, and with the assurance of wonderful online reviews we decided to go with him. He took the truck a few days later and had the body work done in about 6 days - really quick compared to other body shops we had dealt with in the past. The truck looked amazing after the body work, it was affordable, and it was done in a timely manner. We also had some brake work done while the body work was being done, and that went well.

The sales associate assured us that if we canceled within the 3 year time frame we would get 100% of the warranty price back. Well here it is almost 3 years later and Sears will only refund $44 of the $249 price of the warranty. So the sales associate just lied to our face and management will do nothing to refund the full $249. Never shopping here again.</text></sentence><sentence id="1627"><text>I would love to give Planet Ballroom an awesome review, but I just can't. They were not willing to work with me and my fianc&#233; to find a package that was affordable for us. They just wanted us to sign up for a package that cost over $400 a month. I have trouble understanding why they want to charge so much when they have Groupons for $75. We had a great time with our instructor for our four private lessons we got with our Groupon, but when we wanted to continue on there was just no way we could afford the outrageous prices. After talking with the manager, he still wanted to charge over $100 a lesson. When we were trying to negotiate the price, the manager simply stopped replying to our emails. We won't be using Planet Ballroom in the future because we definitely feel like our business is not valued. It was fun while it lasted Planet Ballroom, but consider emailing people back.</text></sentence><sentence id="1628"><text>Dr. Rochelle was so great - the staff was pleasant, the office was in a good location and was very nice. They gave me free samples for the prescriptions they wrote me, and they gave me 2 coupons to get my prescriptions filled for free. I felt really comfortable there and would definitely go back!</text></sentence><sentence id="1629"><text>It was good, but I've had better. The more upscale froyo places such as pinkberry and yoforia definitely are better than Fruiticup, but since there isn't a lot of other froyo options in the university area I would def recommend trying this place. My main problem with Fruiticup was that they didn't have a lot of fresh fruit toppings.</text></sentence><sentence id="1630"><text>The studio has no facilities, insists on playing ridiculous music; I came here to get away from the stress of my divorce, not listen to Sade singing about her breakup. 
The prices have gone through the roof since she opened her tiny studio in Uxbridge, and all it is now is a money grab; Franchise?? really?

Franchises are normally sold once you have a PROVEN idea that works-not just for the owner, but for hte clients and the franchisees. I have been with you since thestart, and am so frustrated now, that I am no longer saying nice things to people about the experiences there.

In short:
1.focus is money; one on one with Shasta used to be $50 now they are $100-$145/hour-did you get a medicl degree we are not aware of?
2.Calls herself a Transformational and life coach; where did you get your psychology degree?I have known her for years and do not recall any of htese things, only selling more positive karma for $$$$.
3.franchise a business that has no showers, change rooms, blaring music and chatting instructors when we are trying to wind down and get over cancer treatments, divorce, pain and general distress over our lous lives; try to complain and they do not care-too busy to care!
4. Telling people that being registered with the CRA for tuition is like getting FREE training; that is NOT how our tax syste, works-it is a tax deduction, not a wage deduction like an RRSP-this is a blatant lie.
5. the majorityof the instructors have come through their own BLY training and have little to no anatomy outside of htis course; One shoule NEVER do compression of the back/core or extreme Flexion within 45 minutes of waking up-there is still too much fluid ont he disks-WHY don't your instructors know that???
6. Education must be broader; ensure they know that they CANNOT do forceful or any other hands on to clients without asking! A rape victom in child's pose does NOT want hands on her back pushing her further into a stretch-WHAT was she thinking?
7. Instructors SHOULD NOT tell clients before a class that hey should come more regularly in order to "get rid of the rest of that belly". Someone with an eating disorder, struggling for years, does not want to hear this-Actually NOBODY should ever have to hear that from anyone! Disrespectful. We thought that BLY was a safe place, but we gues it no longer cares about anything except money.

too bad. 
If you cared, we would be back.</text></sentence><sentence id="1631"><text>The service here sucks.  We waited over 24 mins for food.  Our waitress was oblivious. Once she got our order we didn't see her again.  I finally had to flag someone down.  Then once we got our food she asked how everything was and then she was gone again.

The surroundings are pretty ordinary, but the food and service quite inspired. The Lamb Osso Bucco was as good as I've ever had, and the apple tart for dessert was just right for the three of us.

My husband played in some World Series of Poker events, but forgot to pick up some souvenirs.  I thought it'd be a lost cause trying to find someone half the country away to help me out, but Anything U Want replied quickly to my texts (TEXTS - YAY!).  It was like talking to a real person (haha) and not just a random disinterested far-away rep.  Even though it was just a few t-shirts, they treated my request with professionalism and diligence - it ended up taking a few trips over a few days because the booth wasn't up the first two times.  When it was finally open, they called me to discuss what was in stock and sent pics of what they picked up.  Couldn't be more pleased.  I thought for sure I'd have to give a few-sentence instruction and hope for the best, but this was like working with someone who really cared about my order.  They got it exactly right and were prompt, professional, and communicative!  Will definitely be keeping their number for future needs.</text></sentence><sentence id="1639"><text>Superb service.

He replaced the front of the phone and I was back in business and out of his shop in approx. 40 minutes. Total cost was $199 plus tax.

The professionalism, from the first meeting to the completion of the installation, was second to none.

Was excited to try this new restaurant. Came a day before they opened and the lady at the cash was so friendly and welcoming. Came two days later and was not greeted at all. There was no way to tell where to order ...the guy near the food just looked at me with wide eyes. I asked for a mix plate (chicken n beef) he cuts the beef and asks me about my salad n rice choice. He adds the salad to the main part of the takeout container which is usually meant for rice. As for the rice..he litteraly gave me 3 regular size spoon fulls. Then adds the beef...i told him its mixed plate. He doesnt aknowledge. Removes some of the beef that already has tahini sauce on it and adds some chicken. I go to pay and the cashier is on his phone texting and i was visible to him. I ask if this is where i pay and he says yes and apologizes...i gave him a 20 and later realized he overcharged me by $3.

While standing in the area by the spring water, my 2yo was fussing. I noticed a customer and the cashier looking at us. The customer shook her head and turned back to the cashier and made a motion with her hand smacking her lips. The cashier laughed and made a motion cupping one hand and back hand smacking the cupped hand with his other hand. They looked at us again and the customer kept talking while she was frowned up. 

I went to them and said I know you're not implying I smack my child. They just looked; the customer still frowned up. As I walked away my friend still stood there and said they kept looking at us while making comments. 

After this we spoke with the supervisor who claimed she was the highest in rank there. She seemed to not care because she said I'll talk to him nonchalantly. She said I could go online to get in touch with the corporate office since I wasn't satisfied with her response. She also gave us a card and pen to fill out with comments about the store only to later come back and say she needed the pen back because that was the only one they had. 

Before leaving we talked with a cashier who pointed out the manager to us. Then the cashier who was making the motions with his hands came to where we were and started talking to us saying he has a 5yo so he knows how children act up. Obviously the supervision said something to him. He had an attitude and said he wouldn't be talking to a customer about another customer and we had mistaken the whole thing. 

Once leaving we talked to the manager about the hand gestures the cashier and customer made. He said he's worked with the cashier for years and he wouldn't do anything like that. He claimed the cashier smacks his hands a lot while talking and that when he came over to us told he apologized for his hand gestures. I told the manager our conversation was over because the cashier never mentioned anything about his hand gestures and only had excuses, not an apology. 

It's nice to know that the Whole Foods staff sticks together no matter what from the top on down. I will find out if Corporate sticks by this kind of foolishness. 

Oh... Before I left I saw the cashier pushing the supervisors cart to her car and they were chatting it up for a while.</text></sentence><sentence id="1667"><text>I went in for my normally scheduled maintenance and had the pleasure of working with Dan.

In addition, I was charged ninety nine cents because of my request. This is not how customers should be treated.</text></sentence><sentence id="1677"><text>I attended this location on a Wednesday, one of the days they're open late. I asked the girl working at the reception if an appointment was neccessary for a cut and colour. She informed me that no, an appointment was not needed. She was nice, cheerful and informative. She told me about the current specials as well. I said that I would return the following day. 
The next day, I returned to this location at 5:30 with a friend. We both said that we wanted a colour and cut. It was the same girl working at the front desk. She was disappearing, on and off the phone, and otherwise out to lunch - so to speak. She gave us forms to fill out with our contact information and told us it was an hour to an hour and a half wait - Really, no appointments? She then got on the phone and made herself unavailable. My friend and I stood there waiting for someone to assist us. Eventually, the instructor, who had been busy doing another sudent's highlights in plain view, came over to take our forms and she said she would call us when our spot was open. 
My friend and I went to some shops in the plaza to kill time. 6:45 rolls around and we still hadn't gotten a call. We went back into the school (I don't want to call it a salon...) and let the front desk staff know we were back. We waited until 7... Nothing. They wouldn't even give us an estimate on the time. They said there were two people ahead of us. I struck up conversation with a woman who was also waiting. She said she also came in arounf 5:30 - for a ROOT TOUCH UP - and was STILL waiting. She made a good point... she could have gone home and done it herself in that time. I approached the desk around 7:15 and spoke to a student, the same student who was getting highlights done in her own hair earlier. She told me that as soon as she was done - and pointed to her own hair - she would help me. Um... ok.
At 7:30, we were still not served or given a time that we would be. I approached the desk and informed them we had been waiting 2 HOURS and that this was entirely unacceptable and bullsh-t. The same instructor that was doing highlights on the student earlier had only said "I do apologize." I told her she should be teaching these students professionalism and correct customer service, neither which was present in this place.  I also let her know that I completely understood that this was a SCHOOL and not a salon, and that I therefore knew it would be a little slower but that it was common sense to let their customers know what was going on as we had been waiting. she kept saying "I do apologize"... nothing else. I asked once again what the time frame for waiting would be. She then said half an hour to an hour. I asked her if she was for real... to which she said yes. I then told her we are NOT waiting three hours for this... and told her to dispose of our contact sheets that we initially filled out. I told her, now with an audience of two students - one who was the girl working the front desk - that I had attended this location the previous day and thought the prices, staff and reviews looked good. I told her I had recommended this location to my friends and family to check out. I then explained that I would retract that and that I would never recommend it again.

What a terrible experience. I'm looking at this as a blessing in disguise!</text></sentence><sentence id="1678"><text>I have got to admit it was not what I had imagined when entering Riad.  I'm thinking of a Moroccan feel, very aromatic/herbally, and very calming music.  I also imagined separate rooms for each service offered...What I had received is this..
 
Entering on the 2nd floor of a very old building, into just a regular room with a high chair/foot rest on one end and the manicure station next to it.  Also in the room was the Moroccan sit down/waiting room along with the front desk.  So this small room consist of all of the setting described above.  Then in another room was the facial station/massage station separated by a curtain.
I wouldn't have such an issue with the setting but I did have an issue with the experience/professionalism of the service. Please see below:
 
1)  The short hand and toe fix is just taking off our nail polish and clipping it down.  Followed by continuous filing on your nails that actually was unnecessary because it was already to the skin part of the nail (that really hurt).  Also my cousin had stated that she had extra skin that is near her fingernail so it was already cut to wear she wanted it but the owner insisted she knew what she was doing and that she will cut it.  On top of it, she did not massage my hands nor my foot.  Shows that she really doesn't listen to her customers.  What is nice was the paraffin feet and hand that she provided.
 
2) Then we went into the massage/facial room.  I was given the back scrub first and my cousin was given the facial.  My back scrub was fine.  My cousin's facial was fine for the most part.  Now the funny thing is, so she gave me 20 minutes to relax and then came into the room to wake me up.  I do not think her assistant knew what she was doing for she kept asking the owner what to do.  Then, she told me I had to go shower!  What????  So she stood there in the massage room while I was naked trying to get on my robe (weird). So...she took me to a bathroom down the hall..the bathroom was so disgusting and I had to get up in the stand up shower to rinse off my back  and the paraffin hand/foot treatment.  While I was in the gross disgusting stand up shower, barefoot-keep in mind, the woman opens the door and asks if everything is okay.  Who does that??
 
3) After the shower, I came back and sat in the massage room.  She told me to lay down again and she gave me I guess at most a 15 minute "moroccan massage"-which was not relaxing at all.  And on top of that her hands slipped and punched me in the cheeks.
 
4) Facial was okay.  I don't think the towel they put on me was a clean towel.  I felt like it was the same towel that was probably from my feet.  The facial was nothing spectacular and it did not serve it's justice.
 
I really, really had a bad experience with this massage place.  I feel mostly bad for my cousin because she's never been to a day spa.  What she experienced is not a good impression of what a dayspa should really be.  She was not a licensed massage therapist but yet she wants to do all services.  If you are not experienced..you should not do it.  It says on there she was a licensed podology.  She kept pushing her product line and repeatedly informed her that we were not interested.  At one point, I told her I was from the states and that I was flying home so I wouldn't be able to carry all the products onto the plane.  She suggested that I send it through the post office..ummm I don't think so.  It would cost alot of money to send out of the country.  And last but not least her hidden fees.  So I guess this living social deal did not include the taxes.  She charged 13% for Canadian taxes and then an automatic service fee (which I think is a bunch of bullshit since it was crappy services) of 17%.  So we already paid 99.00 for the services and then forced 30.00 for fees/services?  Really??  

I don't think I will be going back....</text></sentence><sentence id="1679"><text>This is the worst rental car company I've ever dealt with.  Not only did we have to wait for an hour and a half in line to pick up the rental car, but the company added on a additional charges for fuel (even though I filled the tank full within a few miles of the rental car return) as well as late return fees.  

We had returned our vehicle on time according to the rental agreement, and when we did, their system was down.  We asked for a receipt or something showing the car was returned on time and they told us they couldn't provide anything.  When the final charge came in, they added on a late return charge and printed the receipt after their system was back up.  

I will never use this company again and I recommend you avoid them too.  The price is initially low when you reserve a car, but they add on false charges afterward.</text></sentence><sentence id="1680"><text>The food was very average.

Smokers on the patio and a huge dog (brought along by a guest) stared us down the whole time we ate. He even lunged at my husband. The ribs and chicken were dry, as was the Mac and Cheese. The upside is our drinks were great. So I'd say go for drinks, skip the food, don't expect any sort of civility from guests.</text></sentence><sentence id="1681"><text>Harry's is awesome.

Staffs are incompetent, screwed up my order, food took forever to come (we probably sat there for an hour and a half), the servers straight up ignored us when we wanted to ordered food.

Their poutines are decent tho, the server (well... the tall dude) is rude. I don't think they got the hint that we wanted the bill until they saw us standing there with our coat  for good 10 mins with my credit card out.</text></sentence><sentence id="1687"><text>This place does not even deserve 1 star.

Good sushi, fair price, discount of takeout, what's not to like? 

Yesterday, I went there for my usual Love Boat take out order and I noticed that huge price jump. The price for the Love Boat B was 45.99 and it's now 62.99. I was initially confused by it and then realized that they've changed all menus. Looked around and the restaurant is now empty without any take out order then everything started to click and I know why. 

Since I have to wait for the order to come, I went back to my car and grabbed the old menu and went back to the restaurant to compare with the new prices. The lady came by and took my old menu away! Sneaky sneaky

If anyone has any recommendations to any other comparable sushi restaurant, it would be greatly appreciated. $17 price jump on the same order is not cool. As much as I love sushi, I'm not paying that.

I got the chicken bites with fries and a taro bubbletea. The food is incredibly well-seasoned and filled with flavor, the chicken is tender and not too overcooked.

The quality of the food platter was excellent. There was a large selection of sandwiches, biscuits and desserts for everyone and it was quite filling. Each bite had a unique and vibrant flavor. I was blown away, everything just tasted so good.

There is a big variety of teas. We poured ourselves a cup of tea and then rotated our teapots so that we could try everyone's selection. Each tea had its unique aroma and taste.

If I had to complain about one thing, it would be the speed of the service. Our waitress was friendly but there were only two wait staff in the dining area serving a lot of guests at the same, so it took a long time to get our bill and leave. It was an 1 hour and 30 minute seating time but we stayed for 2.5 hours because of the wait.

I got the Mama Mia which is gyro meat on top of a small amount of lettuce, tomatoes and onions, and a dozen small pieces of pita bread. All I could taste was oregano! The meat and the bread were heavy on Oregano, the bread seriously covered. Another odd thing is that their Greek salad doesn't have greek olives. No olives. I also bought a cupcake, which was dry and crumbly as cornbread. It was obviously old.</text></sentence><sentence id="1705"><text>The best thing about our meal there as our server, who was very good at his job! But the place is dirty.

Will pass in the future.</text></sentence><sentence id="1706"><text>Disappointing. The asian salad was good, fresh, nice flavor in the dressing. The focaccia bread, fresh. The strawberry salad was fresh, but the strawberry dressing was overpowering.  Too sweet. A light vinaigrette would have been better. The Thai coconut soup--nice flavor in the broth but the long stringy dry chicken strings in it ruined this soup! Made it very hard to eat, and the strings were dry and ew. like twine in your soup! The bakery case has huge cookies and cupcakes, etc. They look delicious but the reality is stale, non flavorful, dry. The pineapple upside down cupcake was dry, and tasted like a piece of cornbread with an old piece of pineapple on it.  The cream horn was good, but whoopie pies, dry. Stale. I really wanted to love this place, but no.</text></sentence><sentence id="1707"><text>Loved the food! Atmosphere funky and artsy. Staff good. Creative entrees prepared with care.

Second trip--crab "burger" was like a blob of crab salad on a bun. Not real tasty for me. Husband tried the crab and shrimp stuffed portobello- 2 1/2 stars out of 5, he said. It was thickly covered with melted cheese, a (less than) subtle touch it could be much better without. He said the asparagus was good. The service was good, and they did comp my meal, which was nice of them. In the future we will stick to the burgers!! Live music was very pleasant.

Spiedi sandwich: No sauce, just meat and bread. Meat flavored okay, but sandwich lacks. Homemade chips good, but sauce is thinned down ranch dressing. Onion straws very good, fish tacos good. Major problem is service. Understaffed? Don't know but it took 15 mins for server to even come near us and we had to grab her attention to ask for drinks. She complied but acted unwilling at first and took her time reappearing and seemed distracted all night.

Not doughy but not cooked well. The outside was great. Then the cookie dessert was cooked at much too high of a temp and was burned. We ordered another and this one was raw.  After we sent the first cookie dessert back, our waiter disappeared. We did not see him again before we left! We flagged the manager down to finish our transaction.

The facilities are comfortable, with several convenient areas (stadium seating for viewing the pool, snack bar, tables &amp; chairs, playroom).  We've had the opportunity to experience many different instructors, all of whom seem to have a genuine interest in and a special knack for working with young kids.  The swim objectives at each level are clearly demonstrated to the kids during their lessons.  All of the staff, both in and out of the water, are very personable, helpful, and accommodating......whether it relates to fear of the water, scheduling lessons and makeups, a child having a bad day, or swim techniques and advice.  My girls started out with no swim abilities or experience, both of them crying during their lessons for the first few weeks.  Now they both can swim and love coming to class each week!</text></sentence><sentence id="1726"><text>I don't usually write reviews, but I felt this was necessary. Today was my first and last time coming here.
Let's start with my experience with scheduling the appointment. I called the salon and was answered by a man's voice with a simple, "Hello?" I wasn't sure if I dialed the correct number since that was the only thing he said. I asked if it was Binh's Hair Salon and he replied with "Yeah." As that should have been my sign to just hang up and schedule elsewhere, I proceeded to give the business the benefit of the doubt and asked if I could schedule an appointment. The man said, "Yeah, sure," and hung up as soon as I said my requested date and time.
So, the appointment day came and I arrived early. When it was my turn, the woman at the desk told me I could sit in the next available chair. I asked if I could get my hair washed prior to my haircut and she quickly said, "You can or you don't have to, it's five dollars extra if you want your hair washed," and I said yes that's fine. She responded in a way as if it were an inconvenience for her to wash my hair as she directed me to the sink.
Fast forward to the hair cut: as he was cutting my hair, he kept looking away and glancing at the door as he snipped my hair!! My hair ended up looking choppy and uneven. I was so upset with the results, but I didn't want to cause a scene and just paid quickly in order to leave asap.The woman's demeanor quickly changed and she was all of sudden super nice and polite as I pulled out my payment.
If you're wondering, no it has nothing to do with the language barrier, because I'm Vietnamese as well! They were just incredibly rude and unprofessional. Poor quality hair cut and poor attitudes. I thought the other reviews were more honest, but I think it's inaccurate. I probably could have gotten a better haircut and service from a student stylist.</text></sentence><sentence id="1727"><text>This place is awesome! I am addicted to the Save The Planet Curry!

I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. 
 After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. 
Most sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4"x6". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews. Glad you had a good experience but I definitely was disappointed, left hungry and very dissatisfied.</text></sentence><sentence id="1735"><text>I love wontons and have searched the world over for great wontons.

Real good flatbread styles from the other side of the world. Oh and the deserts are real good too, take them to go. In goodness they have tea and such on the house, as is custom. Moustafa runs a good operation here, along with the ladies kept in back. As custom too, lots of smoking and chatting outside, no need to rush off.</text></sentence><sentence id="1742"><text>Boy ole boy, this place rocks me every time I go there. It more than helps if you know some spanish, or do your homework. Otherwise all your questions will be answered like your partially deaf grandparents, 'head shaking yes...', by the short central american ladies.
I had the, Pollo Catracho-Pollo Frito Estilo Hondure&#241;o, on my last venture in there with real genuine horchata. I rolled out of the place literally. They do not miss a beat with sides and fresh condiments. For the gringos, there is the typical bottles of sauces and such. But WTF you need that for when you can eat the roasted jalepeno, onions and radishes. Damn. I have yet to go there for breakfast, because I usually want to do something in the morning rather than go back to sleep. lol. Now you know why they have them images of the mexican having a siesta on the cactus. The dude just ate here!</text></sentence><sentence id="1743"><text>There are days, when this shit is on my mind. Then it sinks down to my stomach and I find myself heading to Popeyes. But stay focused, because its also a minimart gas station, so if your a people person, like me, its like TV, they also have one blaring too. You can also feel outlawish, by getting "free" refills. They also have wi-fi, so you can slow your heart and arteries with greasy chicken and gravy with lots of salt and butter and comb or stalk whatever sites you desire. Plus look at all the weirdos coming and going. Oh and for you antique people, just behind this location is a big ass antique store, so you can waddle your way over, most drive, cause we americans, and settle that chicken looking at stuff you don't need.</text></sentence><sentence id="1744"><text>I eat here many times. I am that single guy people look at and feel sorry for cause I am reading something and ignoring them, unless she is hot ;)
You cannot go wrong with any of the food here. Really.
Now that its winter, its PHO and more PHO.
As custom men will serve you and the women will take your money, haha.
Check it out.</text></sentence><sentence id="1745"><text>Well, a few years ago, I started with the "intro" offer for $35, since then, it has expanded to over a $100 a month for the same service. They double bill you after the intro offer and then begin to add late charges, then start a new "start" date from your original date. I got my service date on the 27th, then they moved it to the 10th and now its the 30th of the previous month, basically cutting me off a month. When the cut you off and you pay, its another "reactivation" fee, yet its all computers. I could go on further with this corporate monster, but you get the picture, yet there is not other here in tempe, some how the politicians have sold it all to two corporations, the internet. Stay away if you can. Its all a scam.</text></sentence><sentence id="1746"><text>OK, so I had the $8.00 lunch. My first question was, what happened to these places??? Beyond the basic food, its filthy, food everywhere and the people, wow. I mean it looks like this is where obese people go to gorge. "Oh, have a pint of ice cream and sugar to wash down that salad" The lady in front of me was scooping some white-yellow pasta stuff out of the serving spoon with her fingers. The decor, whats with the baby shit green color and macro shots of tomatoes sweating? Tomatoes do not sweat. Oh and then some old lady in yoga pants. I mean, baggy yoga pants??? I had my salad and soup and left, the food was ok, but the patrons, leave you feeling no so good. So, if you want cheap nutrition and some OMG moments, go here.</text></sentence><sentence id="1747"><text>My meat was dry again. When you order a drink, they give you a cup and point you to the coke machine, so service is not this place is style. Apache Blvd has become a middle eastern mecca of food, so they will have to shape up or ship out, since better and less expensive delights are all down the street.</text></sentence><sentence id="1748"><text>These cats got it all going for them. Taste, price and coolness. If your all into the scene and need to be catered to, like your paris hilton, don't bother. It also has a great market selection, mine being the deserts and sweets. The plates have some good choice, I go the way of a main kabob, rice (mmmm), hummus and fries. They also lay on the pita bread, so its all good here. Oh, and be sure to bring someone you can converse with or something to read, its not fast food, so relax.</text></sentence><sentence id="1749"><text>First and foremost, this is pretty much TRADITIONAL Navajo food. Not any other native american or american indian type of food. It is the basics, because in the real Navajo world, not the material world of Phoenix and urban areas, there is no electricity and such. Its not food all jazzed up with spices and thick sauces, etc, like americans like and desire. Certainly not the salty taste that is american food, or passes for taste. So, in the area of actual Navajo food, the Scared Hogan does it well. As for the expense, its organic as you can get, but thats the Navajo food way, and not advertised and used as a gimmick, like the american food way, hence, its a bit more in cost. An example is, the mutton (sheep) is bought on the Navajo Nation. Navajo's know tis because we cantaste the difference, between a sheep raised on Navajo land vegetation and sheep not raised on it. 
All in all, the Sacred Hogan, is the best traditional style Navajo food served in the greater Phoenix area, except at my house, haha.</text></sentence><sentence id="1750"><text>You never know with this place. Today it was, "We're out of that right now." I mean, they only have two type of house coffee and one is out. The pumpkin chocolate chip cake was oily, yeah, oily and with the light coffee I settled for, it was all half and half nutmeg taste in my mouth.
Oh and its also one of those places, people with no wi-fi sit around at ;)</text></sentence><sentence id="1751"><text>I go here for one thing only. CORN DOGS!
If you like them good and hot, fresh, then this is your place. Somedays the special is corn dogs and they can be had a for a sweet price. 
This is the place where us fat people get fat, straight up.</text></sentence><sentence id="1752"><text>First off, if you like ambience and decor, don't go here. If you like good Asian and Pacific Rim food, then do go here. These people do not, and I mean do not, f**k around with the good food they serve. What they lack in service, sometimes you got to wait longer than it takes to grow the food, they more than make up in what they do right and thats make good food from their respective origins. To boot, you always have enough to take home, now I know its american to over eat and one serving can serve an entire Vietnam family, but its good, to have some great lunch the next day. Tip: When you go in and see one table, get it. Smile at the lady, maybe even slightly bowing and make for that table. It can get crowded. Oh, and lots and lots of TOGO orders here for those who like TV or children with their food, hence the wait.</text></sentence><sentence id="1753"><text>These people know how its done. I have been there a few times now and I can say with good heart and full stomach, its good. Whats even better, is they treat you with respect. Now I know that may not play out to many people, but to me, the vibe you get from the staff, sets the tone, right off that bat, and its a good vibe here. I even take others there, when i want to be nice and have some class ;)</text></sentence><sentence id="1754"><text>After a good movie at near Harkins, we went to this location in shopville. I order the most basics of greek food, a "gyro". Now, you would think this corporation would at least get this right, no. The meat was dry and four pieces of what passes for tomatoes in america these days, were just awful. So its on to the humus and pita bread. I mean did they store the pita in a steamer? Two of the most basics, ruined and awful.</text></sentence><sentence id="1755"><text>Food City is a "Meeh-he-co" experience in itself. The deli is good for cerviche, burritos and the like. The bakery has those great empanadas, try the pineapple. The fruit and vegetable section is par none, with great variety and prices. Lets just say, their are always mexicans and asian folks buying fruits and vegetables there. They know this stuff. To top it all off, on somedays, they BBQ whole chicken outside on real wood coals, not that charcoal bullshit and not gringo gas, but real bonafide wood. This yardbird is good, and if your real nice, buy some green chiles and ask the person to roast them for you outside and slip them a few dollars ;) Like I said, Meeh-he-co experience.</text></sentence><sentence id="1756"><text>I have been to the UK and this version of the pasty is as good as it gets in the Valley. Its a big deal, since its a rather easy cheap thing to make, I mean its UK, right. People there are broke and always telling you. The atmosphere is basically loud white folks drinking and drinking, loud.  If they could do it take out, they would make some more dough, but it is what it is and its good to check out the other goodies.</text></sentence><sentence id="1757"><text>One after another, so many have tried to open a food place in this very same spot. Along comes this chinese food establishment and BINGO! I have tried it a few times and the last time, it was packed, and with mostly chinese people ;) 
In all my favorite is anything noodles. That tasty well seasoned wok in the kitchen sure makes it taste good every time.
The young waiter staff is at a loss every time, so you gotta take charge here, for instance, don't wait for your check. For you gringos, you gotta ask for anything more than chopsticks, cause they won't ask or provide them, but hey, get it together and learn. Food is good and consistent.</text></sentence><sentence id="1758"><text>I like the basic burger and onion rings, which they do very well. Price wise, its also a deal. The ordeal is with the double line they always form to order is awful and likewise with the pickup area, always crowded and not functional.</text></sentence><sentence id="1759"><text>Boy ole boy, this placed opened up recently and I have been back a few times to try out the menu and its all good. Amir is from Lebanon and does it all that way, with great salads and really good shawarma in beef and chicken. Try the kibbies too, wow.</text></sentence><sentence id="1760"><text>I go here for the fries. If you were raised on potatoes, like me, some days, all you want is fucking potatoes fried. The large portion is enough for two, so you can take some home and pull them (use a knife if your a girl) apart and fry them up with some eggs for breakfast. The other stuff is just that, nothing fancy, yet I still don't know how peanuts fit into it all. Only downside of this location is the MEGA-FLIES. I counted an average of four on my table all the time. Since I was alone, if you looked at me from afar, I looked like one of the Mill Avenue homeless, thrashing about in the corner, complete with brown bag (fries). Its worth to me.</text></sentence><sentence id="1761"><text>Its an OK place, with decent pasta dishes, a fast food type of place with awful decor, the cheap "urban look". The floor is always a mess with food and trash all over, almost overtime I have been there. I like the pesto dish..</text></sentence><sentence id="1762"><text>Harkins is a good theater in general, but I think they switched to the cheap popcorn about a year or two ago. You know the one, the kind that is mostly unpinned corn and small. Dan does a good job over seeing his empire, and giving back to the community.</text></sentence><sentence id="1763"><text>Northern Mexico food, at its best. Beans are homemade and good, have not got sick yet, so its been fresh. You do know, 9/10 times its bad beans, when you get sick, lol.
They throw in some chips and salsa's to spoil your meal, buy hey, its up to you. Service is good and football (soccer in america) is always on, yeah.
I do breakfast here sometimes and its the spot when I am hungry after work, so its a no miss for me. Posole and menudo too, not just on every other full moon when a democrat is president ;)
They also have small bar in the back, but alcohol is not my thing so, who knows.
Check it out, don't be scared.</text></sentence><sentence id="1764"><text>In June, I required emergency repairs on my vehicle.  Mimi at New Look Collision managed my repairs and was able to get special parts delivered and the repairs completed in 48 hours.  What a relief it was to get such great service in a difficult situation.  
Thank you Mimi and New Look Collision!</text></sentence><sentence id="1765"><text>After 11 days driving through the SW in June and in super-heat, I was in Vegas, near the airport, for 3 days (117 degrees) and wanted a massage very much.  I found Susan of Hired Hands Massage from an online search, and she was less than 10 minutes away.  I was able to get a 90 minute deep tissue massage that afternoon.  Excellent massage, great location with shaded parking, and such a reasonable price!  I highly recommend Susan for massage in Las Vegas.</text></sentence><sentence id="1766"><text>Simply HORRIBLE! One hour late when picking us up from home, one hour late picking us up from SFO. Phone staff is rude and never apologized once even though it was 11pm and we were waiting out in the cold weather for over an hour. The driver who eventually picked us up at SFO (after me calling seven times asking where the driver was - and the answer always being 5 minutes) never said a word, never apologized. Picking up other passengers we learned that they had waited even longer - one for TWO HOURS! The drivers going both ways were both reckless and my wife likened it to Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. In short, NEVER, EVER use Marin Door to Door!!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1767"><text>Hayden did a fantastic job on our patio!! It matched perfectly with our house!! Very professional and highly recommended!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1768"><text>Definitely nothing to write home about. Generic Italian food.  Pizza crust wasn't bad, but the pastas we had were on the gummy side.  Also the Mozzarella Carrozza appetizer was nothing more than deep fried grilled cheese sandwich. Tomato sauce tasted like canned tomatoes heated up. Lame.</text></sentence><sentence id="1769"><text>My daughter and I really enjoy eating here. We tend to order the same thing every time because it's so good. She gets the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo and I get the grilled salmon nicoise salad. They both rock. It's cafeteria style all the way up to the point you pay, then you are served the rest of the way by a waiter who brings you your food and takes care of you. The food is always very fresh and delicious. And by the time we're out of there, it costs no more than eating in the food court but the experience and quality of the food are miles beyond. Highly recommended.</text></sentence><sentence id="1770"><text>Decent food mostly. Nothing spectacular. Scallops were gritty which is pretty off-putting . Service was not good, the waitress seemed to take issue with just about any request and forgot items on several occasions. If the service were better I'd consider returning since the location is nice, but I can spent my money better elsewhere.</text></sentence><sentence id="1771"><text>First time patient and new to the area.  Got me in for appointment very quickly. I was so impressed with the front office staff. They can make or break your experience anywhere you go.  They were extremely professional and friendly as well as efficient. The Nurse Practitioner Kristen Branche was professional and friendly. She took her time explaining my concerns.   Lisa, her assistant was very friendly and helpful.  I had a test that was ordered and she went out of her way to make sure I knew where to go.  Just a great experience!    Highly recommend.</text></sentence><sentence id="1772"><text>The best pie I ever had and will ever have.
Definitely go for traditional taste.
I regret that I only ate one piece of it. It seemed a bit big but it was multi thin layer of pie crust made it look big, so you can actually eat a lot of them!
If I visit Toronto again in near future, I must stop by to try other taste like Kiwi.</text></sentence><sentence id="1773"><text>Amazing fresh food.   Different from the norm.   The food is very tasty and we'll seasoned,  a great place to share and catch up with friends.</text></sentence><sentence id="1774"><text>Pretty eh.  I've certainly had worst fast food burgers, but given the relative wealth of burger options in Tempe, I can't imagine why anyone would stop here.</text></sentence><sentence id="1775"><text>Convenience is, indeed, the only reason to go here.  There are a surprising (surprised me, at least) lack of Mexican places within walking distance of this part of downtown Phoenix.  I work in the area, so I end up eating here once a month or so because I've been to the spots around it an exhaustive number of times, or I just really want some beans and rice on a particular day.

Said beans and rice are acceptable but don't rise above that level.  The entrees are meh.  I usually get the tacos because, again, they're generally acceptable if not great.  Like many I found service to be slow and, given that the sub-Filiberto's fast quality of what you get, I don't see any excuse for that.  It's never been particularly busy when I've gone in, so it wasn't that the staff were horribly pressed, either.

You can do better, is the bottom line, but if you REALLY want Mexican on a particular day, El Portal is...there.</text></sentence><sentence id="1776"><text>I am from out of town &amp; just happened to stumble upon this dope little sushi spot with a coworker. The place was super clean and I automatically felt a great vibe when I walked in. The sushi &amp; salad was delicious and the staff really seems to know their stuff. I  wish I could remember my servers name but she kept me smiling and answered any question I threw her way. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!</text></sentence><sentence id="1777"><text>Now this is a great bar! Bartenders were personable and they know how to make a drink. Someone suggested I try Atomic Liquors &amp; Commonwealth. I will NOT be going back to Atomic Liquors it was the worst service and drinks. I WILL definetly  recommend Commonwealth..great bar and service!</text></sentence><sentence id="1778"><text>Worst bar downtown! My girlfriend and I went there for lunch but the only food they serve is off a roach coach that's out front. Not sure if the bartender was new but it took forever to get our drinks and she couldn't even get them right. The worst part is the guy who claims to be the owner was annoying, he keep trying to pick up my friend who is married. Aside from that, he shouldn't be talking to the patrons in that sexual fashion. We will not be going back there!</text></sentence><sentence id="1779"><text>Absolutely nice restaurant with nice decor excellent services and a very nice menu.  I had the Walleye and my wife had the fish tacos, both were excellent.</text></sentence><sentence id="1780"><text>YUM! How can you not like this place? We have visited at least two or three times during each of our Vegas trips and will continue to do so. Cheap, delicious, open ridiculously late (yay Vegas!) and the workers are so friendly. I am not normally a lengua fan but oh my god, the lengua fries and tacos are like an orgasm in your mouth.</text></sentence><sentence id="1781"><text>I'll admit I've only ever had the poutine here, but I'm a repeat poutine customer at J'm la frite as its in my neighbourhood. Usually I've gotten it to-go but one time I dined in with a friend. It's a nice restaurant, clean, nice ambiance. There are several booths that would be equally good for families or for getting lunch with a friend.

I've had the poutine several times over the past two years or so and it's just right (in my opinion; your poutine preferences may vary). A good amount of fresh cheese curds, the fries aren't cut too thick or too thin, and the gravy's not too dark and heavy like at some other places I've eaten. The price is right -- I believe the small poutine (which for me is a generous enough serving) and can of pop I usually get is $9.

Finally, I've always gotten polite and friendly service when I've eaten here. I've taken friends here before and I would do it again if I want to get poutine with them close to home.</text></sentence><sentence id="1782"><text>I went to Best Buy this morning (5/7/2017) to return a defective router that I purchased on 4/13/2017.  I had my receipt. The Customer Service Representative refused to take the product back citing the 15-day return policy.  He further indicated I had to deal with the manufacturer - Belkin.  Again, the router is "dead", after only 24 days.

I pointed out to him that it was a Best Buy floor person that recommended the router, but he would not take the product back.

Basically, I take issue with Best Buy not backing the products they sell; especially when the product fails in a short period of time.  Given that I spent a couple thousand dollars at Best Buy (two computers) over the past six months, plus I am a "Rewards Member", I guess I was expecting too much.

I wound up going to Target to purchase a new router.  It is my intention to avoid buying anything further from Best Buy, given they do not back the products they sell.

For completeness:  Working with Belkin was no better.  it took two phone calls and three associates to get an RMA, which is going to be more of a hassle than it is worth.  I point out this interaction as a caution, because Belkin was surprised that Best Buy would not take the product back.  Again, a classic case of getting caught between two entities, blaming each other.</text></sentence><sentence id="1783"><text>Dr. Yeramilli (sic) is an excellent doctor - very thorough and efficient.  However, I cannot recommend Target Optical for purchasing frames/glasses.  They have a limited selection and frankly, they are very expensive; even with insurance.  In addition, I found my lenses noticeably thicker, even though I ordered their high end lenses - i.e. I am not sure I received what I ordered. 

I can go to Costco Optical and get a superior pair of single-vision glasses (UV, Scratch Resistant, and Transition lenses) for less than half price I paid at Target Optical; plus the frame selection is better.

If I am going to continue spending the amount of money on Target classes, I might as well go to LensCrafters - they have a superior product and frame selection.</text></sentence><sentence id="1784"><text>This place is the spot if you looking for a low key good time. The house DJ is always playing the best tunes. Kaitlin the bartender always puts you in a great mood and is snappy with the drinks. The cocktail waitress Coli has a lot of energy and always has a smile on her face. She will bring you back if your feeling down.</text></sentence><sentence id="1785"><text>Oh My Gosh amazing!!! The Lasagna is to die for, the home made Italian sausage inside is amazing. I will be back again and again every time I come to Charlotte!!! I was here on a Weds night and the bottles of wine were half price, what a deal.

Picture^
I decided on this awesome place due to reviews here and the pics they've uploaded. It's obvious these ladies know color and I was fairly certain they could pull off a faux hawk with shaved sides. :P
After thinking about it and pondering for over a year I finally decided I'd get my dream hair. Walked in to score an appointment for my day off and got Shannon- who penciled me in and seemed interested in what I wanted. :) Which immediately made me feel better. She was very sweet, funny and professional throughout the whole appointment, listened to what I had in mind, looked at the pics I had for vague reference and created my vision with 100% accuracy. My god. I've never been so in love with myself. Everyone- even my fairly conservative parents- say it's gorgeous and is totally ME. 
It's been a week now and I've washed it twice- color is still a strong aqua/teal. -love- And people are STILL complimenting me. 
This place is as laid back as everyone says. Like a tattoo shop for your hair. Will forever come back.
The prices are VERY fair for the skill these women have. My particular color and style took 4 hours.</text></sentence><sentence id="1787"><text>We went there because of the Groupon and had an okay experience. Waitress was very pleasant, but food was nothing to write home about. It could be because that was our first time trying Mediterranean food. Of the 3 dishes we ordered (can't remember their names) we enjoyed 2 of them but they weren't exceptional. The people there are nice.</text></sentence><sentence id="1788"><text>I needed to get a mani-pedi before vacation and stopped by Color Nail Spa because I had received a gift certificate for Christmas. I got a Spa Plus pedicure which, I thought was great and well worth the extra money. I also got a standard manicure. My nail tech suggested I get gel because I was going to the beach and it would last longer. I didn't feel like he was trying to up-sell me on it or pushy about it. He was just very honest that my regular polish would likely chip within a few days at the beach.  I appreciated his honesty. And while I agreed about the gel, I opted to stick with regular polish knowing full well that I'll probably have to touch it up myself. At the end of the day, a regular polish manicure just isn't going to be as long lasting as a gel or acrylic manicure. That's why it's $17 instead of $37. ?

The salon itself was nice, clean and everyone was friendly enough while not being overly pushy to chat when I had my head buried in my phone scanning Facebook and checking emails. I'd recommend this salon for a standard mani-pedi situation - location is great - tons of parking and I thought reasonable prices.</text></sentence><sentence id="1789"><text>I have been a Cardamone's customer for many years and Have recommended it to all of my friends and family! The staff members at Cardamone's are so nice and friendly, they do their best to get you your requested appointment and all of them are so talented and good at what they do! I personally see Jojo, who is not only a fabulous stylist but is also great with color. I never come in with pictures of what I want, I just give her a general idea of what I want and I trust 100% that she will work her magic on my hair. Cardamone's is the best!!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1790"><text>I am extremely afraid of the dentist ever since I was younger and had a cavity filled while I could still feel it. That dentist didn't seem to care &amp; told me I would be okay. It's been over 10 years since I've had any work done on my mouth. I was in constant pain this past week &amp; could barely open my mouth to eat. I found Royal Highlands off of yelp &amp; I'm so glad I came here. The doctor told me I had an impacted &amp; infected wisdom tooth and I should get it removed soon. The whole front desk staff was so kind and helpful throughout everything, especially Jasmine. The day of my extraction they made me feel comfortable and did everything they could to ease my nerves. Dr. Ho let me listen to music to relax and extracted my tooth in less than 5 minutes. I would recommend Royal Highlands to anyone!! 

Thank you all for making this dental experience better than my last one!</text></sentence><sentence id="1791"><text>Recommended by a friend from my hometown and thought I'd give it a try. Food and drinks were great! Potato salad was like nothing I've tasted before...so good! Highly recommend the caramel milkshake. Max, our server, was so friendly and helpful! He made sure we were enjoying our time and was very good at checking up on us. The guy refilling water and taking dishes was so sweet too. They were also able to adjust a meal to my friend's allergy and gluten free requests! If you're in Vegas go to the Venetian hotel (the restaurant is inside by the casinos) for lunch or dinner here...so worth it.</text></sentence><sentence id="1792"><text>Wiseys is exactly what the Leaside area needed!  The meat pies are reasonably priced and are deliciously filling (I bought some for a family brunch and they were a huge hit!).  They also have an impressive selection of sweet and savoury baked goods - i.,e  savoury and blueberry scones are very flavourful and fresh, and the cinnamon donuts are addictive.  I also tried a flat white (coffee) for the first time, and I am now a big fan.  

A really lovely cafe with adorable decor and very friendly staff.  I always look forward to stopping in.</text></sentence><sentence id="1793"><text>A very friendly neighbourhood bakery that serves up some delicious pastries.  Highly recommend the almond croissant (so flaky!), apple-sour cherry pie and cinnamon sugar donut.  Looking forward to trying other items on the menu!</text></sentence><sentence id="1794"><text>A really lovely, family-friendly bakery with the most wonderful staff!  I'm not normally a fan of cream puffs, but the ones at Mon K are delicious - a light pastry with a silky, creamy filling.  Not too sweet and not heavy at all.  Their sandwiches are also tasty (I tried the Croque Monsieur and the Egg salad croissant) and make for a satisfying lunch.  Prices are also very reasonable considering the exceptional quality of the goods.  Looking forward to trying some of their other creations!</text></sentence><sentence id="1795"><text>Although the restaurant looks unremarkable from the outside, the food is fantastic and service attentive. Shared the agedashi tofu and grilled squid appetisers, spider roll , and a Tokujyo Zushi.  Appetizers were cooked to perfection.  The spider roll was made with a very generous portion of tasty soft shell crab - certainly one of the best I've had.  Sushi was very fresh and really did seem to melt in your mouth.

Although my husband and I were stuffed, we curiously eyed the Mandarin Pie on the menu and shared that as well.  Surprisingly light and a good end to a very satisfying meal.  

Next time I will order the omakase.  Can't wait!</text></sentence><sentence id="1796"><text>This is by far my favourite Longos store - clean,  friendly staff and fresh produce.  I recently ordered a cake from the bakery for my daughter's birthday party and was so impressed by the quality.  It was visually appealing, fresh and delicious!  Even the pickiest eaters and harshest critics (adults and children) at the party had only wonderful things to say.  It was also very reasonably priced.</text></sentence><sentence id="1797"><text>Tasty grilled cheese sandwiches in a friendly neighbourhood setting.  My favourites are the Rise &amp; Shine (bacon, scrambled egg, tomato, cheese) and Green Machine (avocado, arugula, pesto, cheese).  If you have room for a little indulgence, also try the grilled banana &amp; nutella sandwich (yum!).  

The owners are very friendly and accommodating.  The establishment is also very kid-friendly.  Board games are available, and the owners even put on a movie for my nieces as a pleasant distraction as we waited for our orders.  Wonderful!</text></sentence><sentence id="1798"><text>Listen, we went to this place and successfully bought booze, let's not exaggerate. But I have never been in a retail establishment that smelled quite like this. I don't know if a sewage line recently ruptured, or if there's a sulfur issue, but this place smells like a dirty diaper ate a burrito and took a dump into another dirty diaper. It smells like an outhouse next to a cemetery next to an abattoir. It smells like death and sadness.

But come here for cheap booze!</text></sentence><sentence id="1799"><text>Longhorn has great food but I do think they are a little pricey!!

The front desk people were very rude to us for no reason and after everything was explained to the manager, he proceeded to ask if we were going to eat breakfast or not like his staff being rude wasn't a priority. So we left and didn't get the chance to try anything.</text></sentence><sentence id="1803"><text>Amazing food! Great portion size with reasonable prices as well!

We will definitely be returning and passing along the word of Hola Cabrito!</text></sentence><sentence id="1807"><text>I love Amano! Small, local, pizza wine bar with great food, service, and ambiance. The fact this establishment doesn't advertise and is found based on word of mouth is my type of place! I have tried the pizza (amazing), pasta, and special of the night (a white fish). 
Closed Monday's, half price bottle of wine on Tuesdays--can't go wrong!</text></sentence><sentence id="1808"><text>I went two days ago for a simple tire tube for my beach cruiser. We installed the tube yesterday and realized immediately it wasn't holding air. Tested the tube under water to find it had a small hole. Brought the tube and original box in today, hoping they'd be kind enough to replace due to the damaged product in which the guy working stated they wouldn't be able to replace and I would have to buy a new one. No kind customer service stating it may have been a preexisting damage from the manufacturing company or anything to keep a customer from returning. I will get my tube elsewhere where they may be friendly enough to replace.</text></sentence><sentence id="1809"><text>Amazing food, so many choices, reasonable prices, all around great place that I can't wait to try for a second (and third) time!</text></sentence><sentence id="1810"><text>I thought this was a very good place if you're in the mood for pizza, salad, or sandwiches. Pizzas are all 10", server stated "thin crust" however I would say more original/pan crust. 

Wings were just okay, nothing to write home about. Great salad, small size is definitely big enough for a meal or to split with someone + a pizza. 

Will be returning when in the area for a fresh pizza and salad</text></sentence><sentence id="1811"><text>Friendly staff, great tasting drink (tried their signature Caribou drink-iced with white mocha and fresh orange peels), seems to have good used book prices as well!</text></sentence><sentence id="1812"><text>Great tucked away, hole in the wall, Thai restaurant!

Must visit for authentic indian food</text></sentence><sentence id="1817"><text>I Love this pharmacy. They are very personable and I feel like a loved one is filling my prescriptions.</text></sentence><sentence id="1818"><text>Great authentic Indian food. Was very skeptical of ordering Indian food as most of Indian restaurants serve tasteless Americanized version of Indian food but this restaurant delivered food to my hotel, on time with perfect amount of masala. Tried goat biryani and dal makhni. If you are Indian looking to revive Dhaba taste buds, look no further.</text></sentence><sentence id="1819"><text>Visited a couple of times over the last 2 years because it's close to home. The food is  okay  but on the expensive side. Service seems disorganized but I never had bad treatment.</text></sentence><sentence id="1820"><text>Panels were installed within 4 months of signing contract, but system took about a year to get running. Responses to emails and calls to them would take weeks to receive a reply. There were problems with getting approvals from APS or the HOA or someone else.  After months of excuses from them, I finally  left a message to our agent to come take the panels off and to cancel the contract . The agent had someone else return my call and we decided to go ahead  and keep the system. They managed to send someone out the next day, but he was 2 hours late for the appointed time and didn't bother to call. Overall it has been a bad experience.  I should have just canceled.</text></sentence><sentence id="1821"><text>Went for lunch. Had the rare beef plus beef balls pho and the boyfriend had the tomato and crab meat noodles. 
Both bowls came steaming hot which was very nice (and rare!) but not sure if that's the reason why my rare beef came pretty well done. The soup is flavourful though! I didn't try the tomato and crab noodles, though my boyfriend said it tasted good. 
We sat at one of the booths, so it felt spacious inside the restaurant. Service was friendly. Would come back!</text></sentence><sentence id="1822"><text>Great decor. Waiter was friendly and helpful. Food delicious. Pretty expensive for the portions given (even though it's tapas, the portions are still pretty small for the price). For example, the pimentos were good but there were probably 8 little peppers in the small bowl ($9 if I remembered correctly). Tried several tapas dishes, really liked the pepper stuffed with manchego and oxtail. The assorted jamon plate is good too!  Not a big fan of the bacon wrapped dates. All in all, it was a good experience.</text></sentence><sentence id="1823"><text>Hip decor, reasonable prices and most importantly FRESH ingredients! What more can one ask for? 

This place has more of a casual fare. You order at the cashier next to the sushi chefs; sit at a table on a stool, and they'll bring you your order along with wooden chopsticks, paper plates and paper cups of water. 

The place seems pretty small and has about 4 communal tables. However, We (group of 6) went at around 2pm on a Saturday and had no trouble finding seats at all. 

Though casual, presentation of the food was pretty!

If you don't live around the area, this place wouldn't catch your eyes and thus harder to find (in the papa chang's plaza). 

I would definitely come back! Next time for their rice bowls! (All under $15!!). Would be a nice choice for a casual date night!</text></sentence><sentence id="1824"><text>Didn't have enough time to eat in, so I had to get take out fish and chips.
Ordered the haddock and chips. Price was reasonable. 
The fish: very crispy and tasted fresh. The batter was in the salty side but very flavourful. 
The chips: thick cut and good. 
The tartar sauce was the only thing I didn't like. Not sure if it was because I ordered take-out, the tartar sauce was prepackaged (like ketchup packs), and was not so good. Hopefully if I eat-in next time, they'll offer fresh house-made tartar sauce!</text></sentence><sentence id="1825"><text>Quaint little local cafe! I had the Dirty London latte (earl grey + espresso latte) and it was fragrant and good! The boyfriend had the espresso ice blended drink, and it was delicious! They also have sweets (eg. Cookies and cakes) and even quiche and empanadas! Will definitely come back!</text></sentence><sentence id="1826"><text>I'm a seafood lover so I was excited to finally try buster's sea cove in the st Lawrence market! There's always a line up there every time I went to the market and this time (a Saturday) there was one as well. Seating was limited, but being there at around 2pm, I was able to find two seats. Even with a line, it didn't take long for the boyfriend to put down an order, so don't be afraid to line up!! 

We recently came back from a trip to Seattle and just loved the clam chowder at pike place market. So, we ordered the New England clam chowder and the haddock fish and chips. 

* New England clam chowder: pike place still takes first place!! But this one at buster's is pretty good. You can taste the clams although it got kind of watery half way through. It didn't feel very hearty to me as there wasn't many chunks of clams or potatoes or what have you. Though, It's a pretty decent chowder. 

* Haddock and chips: I'm not a big fan of the fish and chips here at buster's. The batter is light, but it doesn't have much taste to it. The batter was also not crispy. The haddock itself, is a little dry. I was expecting it to be a tougher texture, but it shouldn't feel dry. Also not much seasoning. Kind of reminds me of fish filets/fish sticks that come in a box in the frozen aisle. The fries, were definitely not made fresh (even with the lineup?!). They weren't crispy nor too soggy. Saving grace was their tartar sauce, it tasted home made and gave the fish some flavour. It also comes with a little container of slaw. 

All in all, my experience here at buster's st Lawrence market was only so-so (food wasn't as fresh and service was a little rushed). Maybe I just had high expectations! Might give the other menu items a try next time.</text></sentence><sentence id="1827"><text>The food is very very good! The restaurant  decor and atmosphere is clean and pretty. I'm not a big meat person but the coffee brisket I loved! Everything on that dish was good: the cole slaw, the corn bread! The boyfriend had the fried honey chicken (spicy) and it was really good too. The chicken is moist on the inside and very crispy on the outside. The corn that came with it was very tasty as well! I didn't get to try the dessert because I had to leave early, but my sister had the crime br&#251;l&#233;e and she said it was amazing! Will definitely go back!</text></sentence><sentence id="1828"><text>This is my second time at scaddabush. I remember the first time was a good experience. This time....was also good! Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. Food was yummy as well. We ordered the carbonara pasta, a pizza, and a few sides. The carbonara was pretty good. There was an egg on top, but it didn't feel like there was egg in the sauce (and thus I felt it was not creamy enough). Pizza was alright. The side dishes were good except for the rosemary fries. I thought that there could've been more rosemary flavour to it. (Note: after we finished the fries, we then realized that the seasonings were all on the bottom of the bowl the fries came with!! So, hint: toss your fries before you devour!). We also had one of the salads (the Tuscan salad?) and it was very flavourful. 
All in all, dinner at Scaddabush was a good experience! The setting was nice and seating was comfortable. One small thing I would've liked: complimentary bread!! ;)</text></sentence><sentence id="1829"><text>Pho mi is so far the best Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. I'm not a huge pho fan, but their pho makes me crave it sometimes! No matter what noodle soup you order, it'll be full of taste with lots of ingredients. You'll leave feeling very full and satisfied for sure. Prices are also reasonable. Restaurant isn't fancy at all and service isn't extremely friendly too, but the food is what makes me come back! 
The broth in the pho is very flavourful, but I find that the "specialty noodles" are the best! Recently tried the chicken curry noodles and it was so good! Doesn't taste too heavy at all!</text></sentence><sentence id="1830"><text>Went during the unionville festival and although it was 10pm, there was still a long lineup. We had the mochi, taro ice cream and Sakura no-bake cheesecake.

Big tip: if you're NOT getting the original flavour cheesecake, then you DO NOT need to line up. There was this lady in line that rudely accused me of butting in line, when there was a sign that clearly says that the line is only for the original cheesecake. So, remember not to be that person! ;) We're all there to have good food, no need to be rude! Just read the signs posted on their store front!

Ok back to the food!

The Mochi (2.50$): We ordered the black sesame Mochi but the girl gave me the red bean instead :'(. It's made with actual sticky rice! So it wasn't that sweet and kind of a little savoury in fact! Wasn't what I expected! It was interesting.

The taro ice cream ($4.50): the first spoon of taro ice cream brought me back to childhood memories of having taro ice cream in HK!! Which means it was very good, albeit a bit on the sweeter side. It comes in a plastic bowl with lid, not bad for price. 

Sakura no-bake cheesecake ($8): it has a nice tart cheesy taste, with graham crumbs on the bottom. It tasted good, but I couldn't really taste the Sakura. It looks very pretty though!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1831"><text>this is one of my family's go-to dim sum restaurants. We don't come here often though because of the long waits for a table. What draws us back, is the cha Siu here. It's a must!! For under $9 you get fresh and tasty cha Siu, big portion with a bowl of rice on the side! Other dim sum are pretty good too. 
Other than the long waits for a table, another little nuisance is the parking here. Never turn into the little plaza where the restaurant is, because there's no space reserved for the restaurant itself! The spaces there are all reserved for other stores in the plaza. So, drive into where the keg is and park there instead, then walk up the small slope to get to the restaurant.</text></sentence><sentence id="1832"><text>Unlike usual Greek spots, you walk into Main Street Greek and you feel comfortable. The decor is simple yet fresh. It's a small restaurant but it feels spacious, so it's nice and quaint. 

Prices aren't bad but not cheap. Food was fresh, which is a high priority for me. 

We tried one of the dips, the pork souvlaki dinner, and the spanakopita. Warm garlic bread was served once we ordered, along with a bottle of tap water. 

The pork souvlaki was the tastiest out of the three items. Very tender and juicy! The dip came with warm pita bread, yum! The spanakopita, though, was a bit cold and hard. 

All in all, it was a nice experience. Food was good and service was friendly. Plus they serve some of the foods on pretty plates!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1833"><text>Fantastic.

The meat was too tough to eat out of the sandwich, could only be eaten with a knife and fork after a lot of chewing, the sandwich bread was burnt to a crisp... definitely not a $16 sandwich. 

In combination with this the service was extremely slow, and took a really long time for us to get the bill or refills on anything.</text></sentence><sentence id="1878"><text>This place has a lot of charm. You can tell the family that runs it is very passionate about what they do. Our server recommended the Cold Sweaty Noodle (I forget the exact name of this dish) it was my favourite of the night, good spice, light, and packed with raw veggies. The broths are definitely different from any other place you will try, but it was an interesting change... not necessarily lacking in flavour as other reviews might suggest, just different. They had a bit more of an acidic flavour. The staff there seemed generally confused and overwhelmed, but they will probably get into the groove of things in a few months. Not one of my top picks, but I look forward to coming back and trying some other items on their menu.</text></sentence><sentence id="1879"><text>Came for some drinks after seeing a movie at Yonge-Dundas. Really enjoyed the beer samples and the staff were very friendly. Wish they dimmed the lights a bit, it was very bright inside for that time of day. Unfortunately we weren't able to stay long enough because last call was 11 on a Saturday night. Hard to understand, because the place was packed and they only needed one or two staff members to keep it going. May consider this place for daytime drinks in the future, would love to come at night since I live in the neighbourhood but unfortunately they're not open to that type of business.</text></sentence><sentence id="1880"><text>The margarita pizza they have with a soprassa-stuffed crust changed my life for real. One of the best Neopolitan style pizzas in the city. The rice balls are also my jam. Staff were attentive and had lots of personality. I'm not even Italian at all - but it made me feel like I was at my Nona's house!!

A homeless lady came in and stole a loaf of bread when we were in line, props to that lady! Gotta give credit to Via Mercanti as well for feeding the homeless.</text></sentence><sentence id="1881"><text>HOLY HOT WAITRESS BATMAN!!!!!!!!! THIS PLACE IS THE SHIZZNIT!!!!!!
So my boy and I saw the travel channel burger special on this joint a week before we went to Vegas and we were all like " YO CUZ WE GOTS TO EATS THESE MEATS". So the morning after our first rage session we  were the first customers in line when it opened. There was also an obnoxious German film crew trying to shoot in their restaurant. After being rude to one of the lovely waitresses and refusing to wear the awesome patients gown we got to experience probably the greatest tongue lashing I've ever witnessed. Dr.Jon came over and told the German douche bags what they could do with the hospital gowns if they didn't like them. Dr. Jon is a true american hero in my opinion because like any good American he knows what happens if you let a pushy German get their way. His vision of american  badassness is a shining beacon of our freedom and should be commended. The burgers, fries, and shakes are  tasty, the waitresses are friendly ,beautiful and playful. If you're downtown you owe it to America to eat here.

  p.s. Dr. Jon if you ever read this know that you are awesome and I am now and forever your biggest fan.  Everyone I ever speak to that is heading to vegas will hear my tale of how my hero Dr. Jon vanquished the snotty Euro film crew sent here to mock our American right to do whatever the f%#ck we want to. I will eat here every time I visit Vegas until I die.


Just revisited this American gem and it was every bit as good as the last time. God bless America and and God bless the good men and women of the Heart attack Grill. Dr. Jon is even more baller than I remember, I'm pretty certain he is the smartest man to ever live.</text></sentence><sentence id="1882"><text>I loved this place. Easily the most hipsters per square inch of any place in Vegas.  I sat at the bar and watched the NBA playoffs and ordered some brews and a burger. The staff was attentive and engaging but not in a cheesy way. The atmosphere was cordial and inviting with some good talent in the hostess and waitress department. The burger was so outstanding I came back two and a half hours later drunk and ordered the Shepard's pie, which was a life changing experience. If you're in Vegas and want a affordable great meal you should definitely hit this place up.</text></sentence><sentence id="1883"><text>Ok so this place is no good in my opinion, would give zero stars if I could.  decided to try em out and ordered delivery a while back and when the food was delivered it was cold with hardly any cheese on the pizza, You could clearly see the bread throughout the whole pie. the wings were also cold. And to top it off the salad was soggy and seemed past it's useful date. Pretty much threw out most of the food because it didn't taste good anyway. Didn't even taste the salad for fear of food poisoning. For pretty hefty prices I was definitely expecting better. Big jimmy's is way better for half the price. I felt like I was ripped off. called them, talked to a staff member she assured me a manager would call. Long story short I called and called and never received a call back. Always just an excuse. "I'm not authorized to issue a full or even partial refund, you'll have to wait for a manager to call you" I must have tried 5 or 6 times. I wouldn't spend your money here. Pretty bad when you get beat by $5 pizza. what disappointed me the most was their lack of concern for a paying customer. A customer who has spent lots of money and used to regularly visit philly's bar and grill, which they are affiliated with.</text></sentence><sentence id="1884"><text>The staff is really friendly and helpful,  Eduardo the manager is excellent.

We worked our way through a couple dresses, it all started coming together and then there it was!

Hungry, we finally arrived to Indie Ale House. To our dismay, the kitchen was closed from 3 to 5 pm; however, the greeter suggested Playa Cabana Cantina across the street for some good eats. What a suggestion that turned out to be.

The prices were a little higher for a typical burrito, but in my opinion, I got what I paid for. I ordered the CARNE MOLIDA PICADILLO BURRITO which is home-ground beef slow-cooked with guajillo-ancho-chipotle. The burrito had a beautiful presentation with green ancho-chili sauce poured on one half with a red, tomatoe sauce poured on the other half. Their sauces were fantastic. They also offered two house-made hot sauces. One was a habenero based hot sauce and the other was a hot sauce made from smoked chilis. Both sauces had a great spice. The smoked hot sauce went great with my dish.

My wife bought the Tres taco option - ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS. This took traditional tacos to another level. As mentioned, Playa Cabana has their sauces down. The liquid in which they braised the short rib was no exception. This option paired extremely well with the habenero hot sauce.

If you are in the area and have no problem with $14-18 for a delicious entre, by all means, try it out. (Not to mention Indie Ale House is right across the street with tastey brews for a good night cap.) When in Toronto again, I will defintely come back.</text></sentence><sentence id="1892"><text>I went there a month ago for a refill ... i showed a picture to my nail technician (Tracy) she said it was very easy to do so i was happy and was looking forward to my new set of nails. It looked nothing like the picture, the nails were so thick and wide (they looked like the 100 layers of polish on them) i went back the next day for her to fix them, i reshowed her the picture and still never got close to what i asked, very disappointed in the quality of work. 

Maggie</text></sentence><sentence id="1893"><text>I booked a king bed room to celebrate my husband's birthday using Red Rock's own website.  We planned to have dinner at T-Bones and stay the night.  We are locals, so this was supposed to be a nice stay-cation for us.   Upon check-in I was advised by front desk employee Yumi that no king bed rooms were available and we'd have to be happy with a room with 2 queen beds.  Even after showing her my reservation for the king bed room, Yumi advised me that my reservation was simply a "preference."  She even threatened to "call security on us" if we continued to express our dissatisfaction at the refusal to honor our room reservation.  Instead of taking ownership of the shortcoming, Yumi chose to blame me for "misunderstanding" Red Rock's online reservation system, repeatedly talking down to me as if I were too obtuse to understand that even though I booked a room with a king bed for my husband's birthday, my booking was actually only a "preference."  No where was this made clear when I made my reservation using Red Rock's online system.  In addition to Yumi's refusal to simply take ownership of the problem, she then threatened us with "calling security" due to our insistence that Red Rock honor my reservation.  I've lived in Nevada my entire life and have stayed at multiple local and strip area hotels, and have never been treated so poorly by a front desk agent.  Even after all the unpleasantries during the check in, Yumi then placed us in a room that looked directly at the parking garage.  I suppose that was her way of "teaching us."  Although we went on to have a very nice dinner at T-Bones that night, Yumi's behavior toward us soured our entire experience.  We'll go back to staying at JW Marriott for our staycations from now on.</text></sentence><sentence id="1894"><text>Sienna Mercato is now on my permanent rotation list for my frequent trips to Pittsburgh. It's three levels of great service and delicious food. 

I started with a craft beer and beef tartar in the beer garden. It's a cool area with a clear roof and open terrace. This would be a great place to join a group of friends, drink a little beer and watch a game on the numerous TVs.  One end is open to Penn Ave.

I then moved to the middle level where I had a good red wine and a very good bacon and clam pizza.  I like this level. I really liked the pizza. 

And, sadly, I'm too full to check out the first level. I'll save that for my next trip. 

All in all, it's now in my top 5 in Pittsburgh.</text></sentence><sentence id="1895"><text>I'm writing this review after about 5 meals at Seviche.

I went in for a massage yesterday because my neck and shoulders were very stiff (I got rear ended a few months ago). As I was lying down, the masseuse placed a heating pad on my lower back. And as she was working on my shoulder / upper back, I noticed that she kept on stopping literally every 2 - 3 seconds (I am NOT exaggerating), and was reaching for something on the heating pad. 
After a few minutes, I finally realized: she had placed her PHONE on my back and was playing with it while giving me a shoulder massage... !!?!?!!! 

Are you speechless? Because I sure was. 

I was in so much disbelief of her unprofessional behavior that I just simply had no idea what to do. 
I finally said "I have somewhere to go, can we end this session short", and got me out of the misery. 

She did not help my symptoms at all whatsoever. This is the 3rd time I've gotten a massage from her, and each session kept getting worse. I have a strong feeling she doesn't like Asians very much. 

Placing your phone on a client's back AND playing with your phone while giving a therapy massage is absolutely unacceptable.</text></sentence><sentence id="1901"><text>Very nice modern rooms, good service, and great location.

The burger was good, I am not denying this, HOWEVER, since moving to New York I've had my share of good burgers. Theirs was reminiscent of a lesser Shake Shack burger: it had the same feel, the same basic taste for all basic ingredients (beef patty, tomatoes, lettuce...) but it lacked the delicious Shack sauce which brings it all together and elevates the whole burger.

Still, the whole was very enjoyable - I would definitively recommend it as a spot when rolling through town.</text></sentence><sentence id="1904"><text>J'adore Juliette &amp; Chocolat. C'est le genre d'endroits, presque un salon de th&#233;, qui manque &#224; New York.

J'ai aussi essay&#233; tous leurs pots de cr&#232;mes (je crois): j'ai ador&#233; le pralin&#233; et le caramel sal&#233;. Ce dernier &#233;tait peut-&#234;tre un peu trop sucr&#233;, mais il &#233;tait en m&#234;me temps tellement bon...

Leurs desserts n'ont pas la richesse de la Maison du Chocolat, ni la complexit&#233; de ceux de H&#233;vin, mais ils sont d&#233;licieux tout de m&#234;me, &#224; leur propre fa&#231;on.

Apr&#232;s, &#231;a m'emp&#234;che pas d'appr&#233;cier des sauces, mais toujours dans un petit pot &#224; c&#244;t&#233; pour pouvoir alterner entre avec et sans sauce. Et puis, du fromage sur des frites? wtf.

Mais j'ai essay&#233; une poutine avec champignons, oignons et boeuf et j'ai chang&#233; d'avis. La poutine est, en fait, une id&#233;e g&#233;nial. Le probl&#232;me c'est qu'elle peut servir &#224; cacher un manque de qualit&#233; du produit (les frites par exemple) en la "noyant" sous une masse de trucs. Mais, &#224; Frite alors!, chaque partie de la poutine et la poutine en son ensemble &#233;taient de qualit&#233;.

Un excellent souvenir de Montr&#233;al.</text></sentence><sentence id="1906"><text>To be honest, I was disappointed by their bagels. I was told that Montr&#233;al bagels could not compare with NY bagels. If I could generalize from this experience, I would say it's true. Ridiculously true.

Places like Ess-a-bagel and Murray Bagels
have ridiculously good sandwiches. Really, I never knew sandwiches could be this good: they are, after all, only slices of stuff between two halves of bread. Those NY bagels elevate sandwiches. By contrast, I got at Fairmount Bagel a simple sandwich. It was good, but there wasn't the the pezzaz that I've come to expect from bagels. Also, the bread was really doughy.

One of the major advantages of this place is that it's cheap: 6,5 CAD for a salmon sandwhich? Yes please! Otherwise, I'll stick to poutine.</text></sentence><sentence id="1907"><text>I would not recommend this community. The office staff is rude, abrasive and unhelpful.

We moved out, meticulously cleaned the unit, passed the move out inspection with flying colors, we were not marked down at all, we were just told we need to pay the $80 "standard cleaning fee" I tried to work with the complex office and advise them thy can't add extra fees that are not in the lease, they refused to help, I tried working with Corporate, they stuck to their guns, they are basically stealing and extra $80 from every tennant at move out, no madder if the unit needs cleaned or not.

I ordered a cocktail that was actually pretty good. Something with sparkling wine and muddled sage I believe. My Mom had a mango martini. That was also pretty good. They are apparently 'known for their martinis'. Though I find it really hard to believe that they're known for anything. 

As an appetizer we had caprese. It was 12 bucks and came with four tomato slices that were not ripe, four pieces of impostor buffalo mozzarella and a flake of basil. Hands down the worst I have ever had. 

Next came the salads. These were made up of a few greens and half a tomato. Seriously? 

For my entree I ordered a mixed veggie type pasta with oil and garlic. 20 bucks down the drain. My boyfriend had the 'special' which was Cioppino. It was 36 dollars and his stomach is feeling ever dollar of it. 

We took our left overs because we just do that and don't want to be wasteful. On the way home the smell of it was so bad we had to pull over to toss it out. 

This place is a crock. They couldn't get me to eat here again at fast food prices. 

For 4 people (And only 2 cocktails) our bill came out to 180 bucks. What a rip off.</text></sentence><sentence id="1909"><text>Super surprised to go to a nail salon outside of LA that got what I wanted. It may not be that way with every technician there.

Really great price point. The owner has the most amazing customer service everrrr!!! I went in New Year's Eve.. And there wasn't a taxi that would pick me up. So she personally drove me.

The food is simple, a little plain but good. Never gotten fries here but the hummus is smooth and has a nice flavor with good quality olive oil, the pitas are warm and fresh (and you get  two so they will fill you up) and I actually like the kufta here better than Layalina's which is saying something because I love that place (but am not a fan of their kufta). Lentil soup is also tasty and filling. The  falafel does leave something to be desired.

No complaints here!</text></sentence><sentence id="1921"><text>A coworker told me this place was better than Layalina, and them's fightin' words, so off I went for lunch.

Interior is nice, airy spacious, a bit loud and echoey with upstairs seating. Not exactly a cozy intimate dinner spot, still retains that fast-foody 'get in, eat, get out' atmosphere of most places on Green.

In order to get a good cross-sample I ordered the mixed grill. Wait was a solid 15 minutes, and there was a steady trickle of customers the whole time (during spring break, I imagine they will be busier during school). The menu said they had hot tea but I saw none in evidence, just a soda fountain, cold bottle drinks behind the counter, and an iced tea server.

Got the food to go and got back to the office. The chicken (shish tawook) was perfectly done, which for white meat at an understaffed restaurant (they had help wanted signs in the window) is a mark in their favor. The beef was also well done and mildly flavorful but not quite the explosion of spiciness that Layalina provides. The kufta kabob was also mild and well-cooked. Nothing was dry or tasteless, the pita bread was fresh, the two sides they give you, one was some kind of jerusalem salad that was 90% tomatoes so I passed on it after taking one bite for review purposes (yup, tomtaoey. Yuck. The things I do for you people) and the other was this odd, neon-pink pickled... something. Not cabbage, not radish, not sure what it was. Its not on the menu. I ate it anyway. It was... pickled radishy but not too strong. Serving sizes were more than enough for lunch unless you're super hungry, I was and still felt full about halfway in but it was good enough that by picking at it over the course of an hour I managed to finish everything but the pita.

The rice was a little on the oily side but good if again, not as spiced as Layalina. All in all this was a nice, freshly-cooked, healthy meal for a great price. I've heard the owners are Afghani so its possible the food is a milder form than I'm used to. Either way it was fresh, hot, tasty and a great deal for the price. I wouldn't do a dinner date here or anything but for a casual nice lunch or dinner that's not the same fast food fare, I definitely recommend it.</text></sentence><sentence id="1922"><text>This is owned by the old original cook/owner of Tang Dynasty in Lincoln Square Mall. If you ever wonder what happened to the food there, it was this: the cook sold it and left. He's now opened a new place and the food's just as good as I remembered it. 

Had the dry-fried string beans, some stir-fried beef and mixed veg dish, the mix platter appetizer and some beef noodle soup. All were quite flavorful and tasty, and not too oily (something that happens often in this town with Chinese food, sadly). Could not stop eating the green beans, even my four year old liked them. For those who use this metric for their Chinese restaurants: every other patron there was native Chinese, both students and older folk. Parking is free, easy and plentiful. 

As others have said, the interior is the exact same (they even still have the beanbag toss game out on the patio and the 'lucky' rock in the lobby from when it was Rock's) just with a bunch of tables thrown in but I'm sure that'll change as it gets established.
The serving staff was efficient (might have to point at the menu item you're ordering) and quick with the food, which was piping hot and obviously freshly made, and quite friendly with my son when he practiced his Chinese on them. 

All in all a nice time, excellent authentic food, easy parking close to campus and convenient hours. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.</text></sentence><sentence id="1923"><text>The bread here is so good. Got the baguette from a place that sources their bread from Pekara and froze it. Reheated it in the oven two days later (16m on 375,  if you're wondering) and it was so good I just ate it plain. Made the best garlic bread from the rest. One star removed for sloooooow service and rather overpriced selections of other things, but man their pastries are good. Sandwiches can be hit or miss and heavy. Ambiance is typical locally-owned college town coffee shop, with eclectic furnishings and local art on the walls etc. Outdoor patio seating is great for nice days. Very walkable location, not so much driveable, parking is limited and metered.</text></sentence><sentence id="1924"><text>My go-to place for documentaries, kung fu films, obscure 80s cartoons and everything else hard to find that you don't want to watch in stuttering grainy footage on youtube. If you like foreign films there is no other place, period.</text></sentence><sentence id="1925"><text>Tried the lunch buffet (takeout). Cheaper than other Indian places in the area but due to the small location size less variety of food as well (half the buffet table is salad bar/dessert/sauces), so it evens out. Nice touch: they weigh the buffet takeout, so you don't have to pay the full price if you don't load up.

Naan: just ok, but I did get takeout so it might've suffered a bit in transit. Naan is best fresh and hot.

veggie korma: very good, nicely spicy, good flavor, vegetables were good quality.

pekora: nicely crunchy even after sitting in a styrofoam box for a few minutes, little salty.

palak chana: good, nicely spicy and flavorful, right thickness of sauce

kidney bean chickpea thing I forget the name of: kind of bland, I usually expect more fire in this dish.

tandoori chicken: not great, surprisingly. It was dry and surprisingly hot (spice wise) while being less flavorful than I'm used to. Maybe it'd just been sitting around for awhile (its hard to make dark meat dry!)

lemon rice: yellow rice with fried peanuts in it. I liked the peanuts, gave it a nice crunch, but didn't really taste anything else flavor wise; could've just been plain old basmati rice.

chicken curry: ok, this is why this place dropped a full star. The chicken curry is bone in, which would be fine if it were whole bone, but the bone is cleaver-chopped, which leaves tiny shards of barely-detectable bone EVERYWHERE. Seriously I was picking through this thing like I was dissecting in a lab to make sure I didn't kill myself with every bite. I don't even remember how it tasted. I realize this is 'authentic' but so is using a cow-dung oven to make naan and I'm betting they don't do that. Debone your chicken curry, you're gonna get sued.

The interior decor is really quite nice (a huge change from when it was Wonderdogs, you won't recognize the place), the music wasn't too loud, there was a refreshing lack of tv blaring in the corner, the proprietors are very nice and conscientious, and things were moving along well in such a tight space (you're not going to like it at lunch rush if you're claustrophobic/have a phobia of strange people bumping up against/brushing by you). The vegetarian dishes are better than the meat dishes, and I didn't try everything available on the lunch buffet (two or three more items, a lentil soup, desserts (mango custard sounds really good but I didn't want to mingle flavors).

Feels like the vegetarian dishes were better than the meat-based ones, and there is plenty of vegetarian on offer. Wish they'd add samosas to the buffet. Overall I'd recommend it if you want Indian buffet but don't want/don't have time to leave campus, just avoid the chicken curry, especially if you're feeding kids or something.</text></sentence><sentence id="1926"><text>This place is nice, always busy  (its also a gym), the therapists are friendly, listen well, joke around with you, but really know their stuff. The Mettler Release Technique is freaking magical. I have adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) and had surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff which may well have caused or contributed to it, and Jeff (mentioned in the review above) decided to give MRT a try. 

The effects were immediate; keep in mind this shoulder had been affected for two+ years, and suddenly  after only a few minutes of manipulation I was able to move it further than I'd been able to before with much much much less pain, and this improvement didn't go away after a few hours as it often did with conventional massage. I would strongly recommend anyone with mobility issues due to scar tissue who is considering surgical intervention to at least try this first. I was a complete skeptic going in. I'm writing Paul Mettler a fan letter now.</text></sentence><sentence id="1927"><text>This is my go-to place for organic and pastured meats. Prices are better than Strawberry Fields, sometimes by an order of magnitude, the selection is usually wider and they are less likely to be sold out of the stuff I want. Produce is pretty nonexistent yes, they sell out of milk fast but if you're in need of sugar substitutes or hard to find herbs and spices they are awesome (check back in the back by the bulk foods).

Also the lunch counter makes awesome sandwiches and very good Thai food (owner's husband is Thai and used to operate one of the best restaurants in Bloomington, I think it was). I like the noodle soups especially.</text></sentence><sentence id="1928"><text>Good fast Mexican food right on green st. They make their own hot sauces and have margaritas and Jarritos and horchata. Friendly guys behind the counter if you like futbol it's always on.</text></sentence><sentence id="1929"><text>Layalina has closed; a Chinese restaurant called Schezwan Chinese is going in there now. Rumors abound about why, most revolving around unpaid rent. Goodbye Layalina, we hardly knew ye :( If you're still on the lookout for good Med food, check out Mashawi Grill on Green St.</text></sentence><sentence id="1930"><text>Zelma's is now closed, we got one of their last five pizzas. The guy behind the counter said to look for a new place in March, they're apparently selling it.</text></sentence><sentence id="1931"><text>This store is dangerous for people who like camping gadgets. I am one of those people. I can never get out of here without some doohickey that I never realized existed before I walked in yet now cannot live without. 

They have all your typical outdoor brands but the prices are a bit... pricey (fifty bucks for a kid's windbreaker, really? REALLY?) I will forgive them for this because they have ALL THE SMARTWOOL. ALL OF IT. Seriously if you have not bought smartwool socks before do yourself a favor, wait for them to go on sale and just buy them. Especially this last winter I lived in smartwool socks and tights and the medium-weight hiking socks are so thick and comfortable I use them as slippers.

Anyway the sales people have always been helpful and friendly if a little harried on busy days, and if the person you're asking doesn't know something they know who to ask (go on weekends if you're looking for the hard-core grizzled mountain men type guys who know all the knots in the world and how to arm wrestle a bear).</text></sentence><sentence id="1932"><text>These guys are great, very good with kids, eyewear selection is wide and they do free refittings (which is great when your 8 year old is as rough on his glasses as mine is).

Dr. Leon as mentioned previously is a man who obviously loves his job, and takes the time to explain all the stuff to curious kids who ask a million questions. He even managed to diagnose an issue in my left eye that had never before been diagnosed and explained it to me in a way I could understand (and also why lasik couldn't fix it). 

They take all kinds of insurance (including university insurance) so you should be covered. The offices are lovely and cozy. They have all the bells and whistles your heart could desire if you're that kind of patient, but they also do standard eye exams and are open on Saturdays as well. I've managed to be seen same day after accidentally splashing toilet bowl cleaner in my eye and my kid managing to take a blow to the eye during a soccer game, same level of service as other days of the week.

Very very happy with this place and its doctors.</text></sentence><sentence id="1933"><text>This place is apparently a hugely famous Korean coffee chain that's all over Southeast Asia and was brought here to cater to the foreign Asian student population. I got the Thai milk bubble tea and it was certainly... milky. There was a Thai iced tea flavor/color to it, I'll give them that, dunno how well it mixes with tapioca pearls, and for the price I'll go across the street to Basil Thai. Everything in here was hilariously expensive. I got a blueberry muffin that could have been purchased at Sam's Club by the pallet for the same level of quality. The place is clean, the uniforms are cute, and I'm sure the homesick ex-pats will keep it in business, but for those prices vs. quality I'll be going elsewhere.</text></sentence><sentence id="1934"><text>Two words: food poisoning. ACUTE food poisoning. Knew I should have trusted my instincts when I saw them prepping food on the same cutting board they had just cut raw meat on. Food was pre-cooked and reheated and still tasted overly salty and the wait was ridiculous (said 10m, waited over 20). This is the second time I've given this place a chance and the second disappointment. Won't be a third.</text></sentence><sentence id="1935"><text>Love their pho, best on or off campus. I still remember the first time I had it, I was stuffed to bursting but still had a bowl of that delicious broth left and I honestly felt guilty about throwing it out. The rest of Thai food is serviceable but I only come for the pho. 

Word of warning: in the cold winter months this place is FREEZING because of a combination of the heavy foot traffic leaving the doors constantly open and the location in the mini mall. The doors face right into the wind which is funneled right down that corridor like a wind tunnel.  The inside is also always cramped and packed though turnover is quick so tables tend to open up regularly. I would do takeout a lot more if it wasn't such a hassle for pho (multiple containers to separate the noodles/broth/garnish and you need a big Chinese soup bowl to put it in once you get where you're going). 

The folks behind the counter are great friendly but busy so don't expect a lot of chitchat at lunch rush. They do speak Thai and you will get major brownie points if you can summon up a friendly sawat dee or kup kum krap/kah.</text></sentence><sentence id="1936"><text>Wonderful pizza, wonderful people. If you are a Chicago native and like stuffed pizza, order here. If you are not a Chicago native and don't know wtf a stuffed pizza is, order from here. Know that you will be waiting 40 minutes. They make it when you call, none sitting around. I'd pick it up, the drivers will go just about anywhere but you're adding on delivery time that you could be spending eating fresh hot pizza. This is not a sit down place, its counter only, but the owners are pleasant and chatty, the place spotless, and the pizza is awesome. Try the dessert pizza too.</text></sentence><sentence id="1937"><text>I really enjoyed my limo service with bell the driver Dave was sure pleasant and knowledgeable about the area . I will be checking out on Thursday  and we have had a blast here.  Will call bell again. Thank you</text></sentence><sentence id="1938"><text>Enterprise's customer service blew us away.  We arrived on Easter Sunday to a clean facility, short line and speedy assistance.  The counter rep was friendly and helpful,  and we were welcomed with a courteous greeting and bottles of cold water when we went downstairs to pick up our car.  Another rep showed us several cars  to choose from and answered our questions with patience and professionalism.  Returning the car was just as easy.

I removed one star because the rep made a point of emphasizing that Arizona is a "no-fault" state and we'd be liable for lost use of the car if it landed in the shop, regardless of whether the other driver was at fault.  With over $200 in added insurance and a $10 a day upgrade, our original weekly rental of $197 burgeoned into well over $525.  

I don't blame Enterprise - we should have researched our liability in advance.  But they do prey upon travelers' anxiety when they're eager to hit the road and start their vacations.  It's a scam.</text></sentence><sentence id="1939"><text>If you have never tried laser or are just looking for a laser place look no further than Simply Skin!

Brought In a pair of Jimmy Choo's and Manolo's and they made them both look like new, including new soles and polish, etc.  I was ready to throw them both away they looked so bad. They also do a great job of putting rubber soles on brand new shoes that don't already have them (to avoid slips) and it doesn't take away from the look of the shoe. Highly recommend this place.</text></sentence><sentence id="1945"><text>We came here for dinner and the service was outstanding and the food was just excellent.  This restaurant is a hidden gem!</text></sentence><sentence id="1946"><text>We came for the Sunday brunch.  It's expensive but you can skip lunch after eating here.  Great variety - typical breakfast food like omelets , a variety of cheeses, breads and fruit but also has crepes and nice salads.  They also bring six different meats to your table - the Chicken Parmesan was my favorite (even better than the beef).  It costs $30 per person - I would recommend this for a nice brunch with lots of variety.</text></sentence><sentence id="1947"><text>Service was outstanding.  I ordered pasta arrabiata and it was quite good.  The coffee is very good here too along with the pizza crust.</text></sentence><sentence id="1948"><text>I walked in here to try it and had a Greenhouse Juicery bottle in my hand and I was asked to put it away.  Please.  I was immediately irritated.  In no way was my juice going to take away from the business I gave to you - until you said that.  Then I ordered less simply because of the rudeness.  Your food is nowhere in the same league so you should take whatever business you can get and be glad anyone stops in.</text></sentence><sentence id="1949"><text>My husband and I came here for appetizers and drinks only.  Reasonably priced, nice interior, accommodating waitress, and food was pretty good.  It wasn't anything fantastic but I'd return for a decent meal.  The drinks we ordered were small, however, and not that much bigger than a shot glass it seemed.  Maybe it was just the type of drink we ordered but the glasses were quite small.</text></sentence><sentence id="1950"><text>The turkey meatballs are delicious!  Nice atmosphere and good service.

It was very good and served with a small salad. Very nice atmosphere.</text></sentence><sentence id="1953"><text>Nice place to eat on a patio in the summer.  We ordered the guacamole which our waiter said was the best.  I wouldn't say it was the best but it was quite good.  Our dishes were also tasty and we didn't walk out of this restaurant feeling stuffed (unlike most Mexican restaurants).  The mojitos are excellent.</text></sentence><sentence id="1954"><text>Food was very good.  My friend had the torn pasta and I had the roasted pickerel.

All of the best brands in one place including some very unique ones you won't find anywhere else.  The best women's clothing boutique in Toronto!</text></sentence><sentence id="1958"><text>This buffet is amazing.  Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth the splurge.  I recommend that you look at everything first and then decide what to get, because you can't possibly try everything.  I missed an entire corner of great food that I didn't see at first, and then I was too full to eat more. I like how everything is on little plates, bowls, or baskets, so everything doesn't get mixed together.  Lines are long, but you can check in and then they text when your time is almost up.  The wait time was less than they had said it would be, so don't go far away to wait.</text></sentence><sentence id="1959"><text>I wish I had read the reviews prior to hiring this company to conduct an estate sale at my two vacation houses that are located side by side.  DO NOT use this company!  An estate sale is usually held at a time of stress, death, or moving to a retirement home, when you are vulnerable. That was not my situation, but she CANNOT BE TRUSTED with your family belongings!  Both houses were complete turn-key rentals with all furniture, d&#233;cor, household goods, linens, etc.  Some of the items were exquisite, especially compared to the other sales shown on her website. There was a mix of things and various quality and values.  I had already conducted three of my own estate sales for other vacation homes that my company was emptying out, and I didn't have time to do another sale. I made a lot of money at my own sales, and I know what stuff sells and what doesn't.  I am also an avid estate/garage sale shopper, so I do know prices. I was going out of town, so I thought this was a great idea - WRONG!  I feel scammed and robbed.  So many things went wrong -- I can't possibly list them all here.  Numerous people told me later that they had been at the sale and said it was very disorganized, nothing was priced, she was on the phone all the time, was just stuffing money into her overalls and not accounting for anything at all!  She doesn't say what she sold major items for (even though I had set minimum prices), provides no accounting whatsoever, and she brought over a lot of her own JUNK to sell.  I think she keeps stuff left over from other sales  (she says she donates it), and then she sells it and pockets the money herself, mixing up the funds of her clients.  Damage was done to both houses from people moving furniture, the carpets were filthy, and items were stolen, including a fixture from the shower!  There were only 3 people working both houses and she had told me there would be 5 -- 2 people at each house, plus herself.  How else could you make sure people weren't stealing stuff, if there is no one there watching?!  Something doesn't add up about this company, and I cannot believe she is still in business.  She also doesn't tell you what the extra fees will be for signs, email blasts, etc.  Very deceptive.</text></sentence><sentence id="1960"><text>I live in Las Vegas, and last week I stayed at the Palms for 3 nights for a "staycation".  I made the reservation online and paid with a credit card.  When I checked in, I was told that because I am a local, they thought I might be having a PARTY in the room, so there would be a $250 PER NIGHT security deposit, for a total of $750.  I am a single 58 year old woman, not a 21 year old party animal!  The $750 was charged to my credit card, not as a hold, but as an actual charge, and it will take several days after check-out to be credited back to my card.  I did not rent a big suite and the room I had was certainly not big enough to have a party.  The Palms is known for their big party suites--why else would you rent a big party suite if you were NOT going to have a party?  According to their logic, locals might have a party in their room, but tourists pack 6 guests in their basic small room and that is NOT a party?  It's the tourists that come here to party!  If I wanted to have a party, I would have it at my house, not a small hotel room with no refrigerator!  Why was the security deposit $250 PER NIGHT?  Obviously, when the maid cleaned the room after the first and second day, she could see that I had not had a party there the night before.  I am thoroughly insulted and will not stay at the Palms again for my next staycation.  Also, the resort fee of over $30 is a joke.  I know all the hotels here do it, but why is that legal?  Since it is not an optional charge, it should be part of the room rate.  It doesn't even include decent WiFi.  You have to pay extra to get faster than a 1 mg speed.</text></sentence><sentence id="1961"><text>Oh man, the interior of this place needs a Gordon Ramsay make over.  It kind of looks more like an office rather than restaurant.  I ordered take out, and the food was surprisingly delicious.  Bhuna gosht and Daal masala were great with the garlic naan.

Your grandma will love it if she's not on a fixed income.</text></sentence><sentence id="1983"><text>If you are female I would not recommend this place!  Stay away service contracts etc added in after being shuffled through 5 salesmen!  Really it is the epitome of the "old car" sales place!  If you like that sort of thing this is your place if not there are so many other places to give your money!</text></sentence><sentence id="1984"><text>Went on a Sunday and the gal did not use sanitised tools!  Ok If nothing else the cheapest thing is to be clean!!!!!  It takes one time to get some kind of infection and lose a finger.  I think the owner was not there that day so I hope she reads and takes care of this problem!</text></sentence><sentence id="1985"><text>The pizza was ok and the chips as an appetizer were good. Anna our waitress was very pleasant and did a great job!!!</text></sentence><sentence id="1986"><text>Pretty awesome Thai food. Can't say more than have the fresh and spring rolls and as much pad Thai as you can get your hands on!</text></sentence><sentence id="1987"><text>The perfect joint to bring a book (Or a comic book) and enjoy a coffee on a cold winter day. Although the atmosphere is perfect, the coffee could be better</text></sentence><sentence id="1988"><text>My favourite cafe in Toronto. Great coffee with flourishes of that little something that most coffee joints miss. With enough attitude to stand out but stay cheery, I'll never stop going to Balzacs</text></sentence><sentence id="1989"><text>Great decor and atmosphere for a party but with all the music and chatter, there's not a balcony to escape the noise.</text></sentence><sentence id="1990"><text>Great quality cheap and cheery sushi. The dragon rolls are to DIE for. but the chirashi needs improvement</text></sentence><sentence id="1991"><text>Decent quality sushi, but we're in it for the beef cup, a cup full of steamed rice, veggies and most importantly braised teryaki beef. It's good and in a huge enough portion to split two way. Perfect for a cheep take out or on the run lunch, although during lunch hour, sushi lovers can get surprisingly busy, I mean it's so crowded, you can barely fit in. So without the crowd it's zippy but with, it's nauseatingly slow. Still pretty awesome though.

Sushi Lovers top 3:
1) beef cup
2) glass noodle
3) surprisingly awesome ramen</text></sentence><sentence id="1992"><text>While very good you can't help but feel you're not wanted in the Boxcar Social, a cafe with good quality stuff, but a little too much attitude. The decor is nice though.</text></sentence><sentence id="1993"><text>Easily my favourite Thai in Toronto, Sabai Sabai's fantastic food seems effortless although creative and monstrously delicious. It really is perfect.</text></sentence><sentence id="1994"><text>Black camel is pure awesome. It's small, inexpensive and packs a crazy punch. I highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich with barbecue sauce 
and a brio. It's quick, great and convenient if you're getting off the Rose-dale subway. The black camel is THE SANDWICH PLACE.</text></sentence><sentence id="1995"><text>My favourite burger place in town, hands down. Also, their kimchi fries are to die for!</text></sentence><sentence id="1996"><text>Lee Chen is one of the most underrated restaurants in Toronto. It's really good, the decor is great and it's food is delicious. It's fun, cheap and really awesome. Despite some flaws, Lee Chen is great.</text></sentence><sentence id="1997"><text>E</text></sentence><sentence id="1998"><text>Boasting great chicken potato wraps for only five dollars, and an extremely good lentil soup, Mystic Muffin is one of my Toronto staples, partly because of Elias, who's a really nice guy. This all together creates a fantastic atmosphere and great place. But the APPLE CAKE IS AMAZING! It's actually so good it's unbelievable. So mystic muffin gets a five out of five.</text></sentence><sentence id="1999"><text>Nice location, pretty good food, solid service and decent prices!
Very close to the water!</text></sentence></sentences>
