        <text>Christmas gift for my daughter who LOVES electronics.  I was a little disappointed that I could not find the Dr. Dre Beats that she wanted.  She says she likes these better because its blue tooth and she can wear then and no one knows she has them on.  Its 6 months later and she STILL loves them and thanks me often for them.  Yes!!!</text>

        <text>I have no idea how Motorola can claim this as ever being a 'flagship' of their stereo bluetooth headphones.  I had no problem syncing it, installing it, figuring out how to use the buttons (though they are a bit small and annoying).  However, I never use it, because it drops syncing with no provocation.  Compared to my much cheaper motorola stereo bluetooth headphones (S305), these simply do not work.  They sync for 3 minutes and then drop the connection.  I can re-sync, I can stand in the exact same spot listening to the exact same music on the exact same phone as my S305, and the S305 works just fine and this piece of carp just skips and then drops the signal.  And this is using a MOTOROLA phone! (Z6m)Do not buy any S9 or S10 or S-anything from Motorola, unless you like to curse.  My only questions, how could the S9-HD be an upgrade from the S9?  The S9 must be used as a coat hook only.</text>
    </sentence>
    <sentence id="8002">
        <text>I was able to directly compare both the S10-HD and the S9-HD side by side, and here are my impressions.I read the reviews about the S10, especially the negative ones, about the tight fit, discomfort, and lack of bass response.  I needed a pair of bluetooth headphones for running, and since the S10 was specifically designed to be water resistant, I tried to convince myself the naysayers were just not using the headphones correctly.  Well, I was wrong.  The S10 headphones are every bit as uncomfortable as people have said:  specifically, they squeeze a small spot directly above your ear.  I cannot see myself using them for longer than 10 minutes without discomfort.  Also, I was a bit disappointed by the sound quality when I first tried them on, but didn't know how bad it was until I tried on the S9 headphones.The S9 is lighter, more comfortable, and sounds much nicer in terms of audio quality than the S10.  The material that contacts the skin has a more padded texture, and the headphone itself is less rigid so they don't grip as tightly as the S10.  This is not a bad thing, as the lightness of the S9 still allows it to be worn securely in place.  The most noticeable difference was the fidelity.  The S9 has much nicer bass response, but don't let that distract you from the whole soundscape.  The S9 performs better across all frequencys, and really separates the instruments and vocals.  The soundstage is very nice with the S9s.Overall, the only "benefit" of the S10 is that it is designed more for exercising, and is supposed to be more water resistant.  I wasn't able to test this, but there are plenty of reviewers that say their S10s shorted out due to sweat/moisture.  That said, I'll stick with the S9s.  I'm only marking down one star because the design doesn't allow them to be easily worn with most eye glasses... but this is a minor complaint.UPDATE: I've been comparing the two sets again... and found some drawbacks to the S9-HD, surprise surprise.  Battery life: S10-HD is better.  Reception: S10-HD is better.  Why can't Motorola design a headset with the comfort and fidelity of the S9-HD, and the ruggedness, battery life, and Bluetooth reception of the S10-HD??  Are you afraid of making your headphones TOO awesome Motorola?</text>

        <text>I tried the S9 because of the reviews. A mistake!!! The fit, wrapping around the back of the neck and pulling on the ears, drives me crazy. I used the S9 only for iMac computer. Had a terrible time pairing.But the tight grabbing at the neck fit was totally un acceptable.Exchanged for the Jabra Halo BT650s set and have loved the Jabra Halo 100%.</text>

        <text>These headphones connect very easily to the iPhone 3GS and sound pretty good.  The freedom from wires is great. Battery life is long (3 hours, about) and recharge is quick.  Fit is fine, though they should be adjusted to avoid or delay the 'head vise' feeling. The larger ear adaptors did better blocking ambient noise but they did not stay fixed to the phones very well, they fall off too easily.  The smaller adapters block some noise but not like deep ear canal buds, better for keeping track of traffic, etc.</text>

        <text>These are great for walking, or other low-impact activities.  However, they were really not about to stay put on my head when I was running at the gym.  I spent much of that workout fiddling with them before I finally gave up.  Great sound quality and easy to use though; I'll keep them for use around the house or at the office :)</text>

        <text>Item arrived as described and delivery was quick.  I would do business with this company again.  These are the best active headsets for the price.  I've had several of these headsets as well as others and I found that this is the best pair out on the market.  There is a newer model (S-10) but the reviews on it was not very positive.  The reviewers recommended sticking to this model because S-10's do not have the same sound quality as these.  My only complaint is that they are not fully sweat proof.  The reason I've had several over the years is because moisture and water tend to get in the ear buds and controls causing the headsets to malfunction.  On the other hand, I've bought other brands and they do not even come close to the kind of quality as these models.  I've had one pair last as long as a year and some last 3-6 months.  I'm an avid trainer so I sweat a lot.  I think it's a good trade off considering the other options.  I do wish Motorola does resolve this issue with future models though.Oh, and don't fall for the imitations that come from China.  I had three of them and always returned or asked for my money back.  They are cheaper but the quality is just ridiculously poor.  To combat this, I always check to see if the product is being delivered from China.  Also make sure that the product description says brand new and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer).  You can also insure the headset with SquareTrade Warranties for like $7.  The extended warranty will cover up to a year after the original factory warranty which should give you 2 years of coverage.  I've also returned a pair to Motorola within the 1 year warranty period and my experience with them was very positive.  From my experience, these are the best models out their for very active and sweaty people.</text>

        <text>First, item is not water-proof (shorted out after a light rain), so i doubt how effective they are at being sweat resistant, its likely they will short out eventually with heavy sweat...2nd the function button dont work properly on it, seems that the problem are unique to each type of apple device being used when I read on amazon; for my ipod touch 3gen, no "skip to next song" button..if the price came down on these to 20-30 bucks they would be worth having but at $45 plus pass...BTW if your thinking, "then ill try the other models", I would be highly cautions, after all this model is their latest!!UPDATE: MOTOROLA NOW HAS THE S10...I wonder how long it will take these model to go down to my ideal price???</text>

        <text>I wanted to listen to music on my HTC Diamond [Sprint] while exercising and around the house, without wires. This unit has good sound, and nice controls - I can activate voice command for hands free dialing, and I can change music tracks without pulling out the phone; Nice.Unfortunately, the thing is really uncomfortable after a while, especially while wearing my glasses. Note, however, that I have a large head, and the unit is not adjustable [like that would have been difficult to design in].Additionally, and I knew this before purchasing by reading other reviews, you cannot carry your phone in your front pocket while using these outside. I put the phone in my rear pocket if walking, but I'll have to wear a fanny pack or some other trick to get the transmitter within line-of-sight of the back of the headset. This is another pain-in-the-rear [no pun intended!].I will say it's really cool to be out for a run when the phone rings and the auto-answer is turned on; the unit picks up and I can talk without having to slow down. I can dial out, as well, with the voice command.The bluetooth technology is limited, but I think the designers could have made this more friendly.This unit may just be the best available, for now, but it seems likes it should still be in "beta" to me.</text>

        <text>Purchased these in January 2011 and as of May 2011 I still LOVE these headphones with my iPhone 4--so nice not to have a cord getting in the way or getting stuck on my collar (hate that apple mic--should be more 'rounded', so it doesn't get snagged!).PROS:- Great sound--excellent bass (optional setting to turn off is nice, but it sounds so much better on)- Comfortable for long-time use (I tested up to 3 hours and they were perfectly comfortable for me)- 15-20 ft. range- GREAT battery life - lasts for days on standby.  I charge overnight and it lasts all day (I have a 3+ hour commute, twice a day)- Remote buttons on headset work great with iPhone 4 (all buttons functional)- Works perfectly with PS3- Nice feature to turn off blue, glowing button, so you're not alerting the world that you're wearing expensive headphones- No chords to get tangled, when you take them out of your bag - nothing dangling around as you run/walkCONS:- Sort of uncomfortable in the winter, if you are all bundled up--back 'bar' gets in the way of your jacket or scarf, but I imagine these will ROCK in the Summertime.  Lying down with these is unfortunately not an option, either, but expected for 'behind-the-ear' headphones- Signal can drop outside, in open spaces--placement is key (not in front pocket, but in side bag, backpack or on arm, using arm band). In NYC, I only noticed it when crossing streets.  This is due to how a bluetooth signal is broadcast.  Putting my iPhone in my messenger bag, however, completely solved the problem and I experience no skips at all in sound.- Phone calls work great and I can hear person on the other end just fine, BUT some have mentioned they can't hear me very well.  UPDATE 5/22/2011:  Not great in a Jeep (of course--nothing is:), but I've called others who said they could not tell I was on a headset.  Granted, I was in my home, but it was really nice just walking around the house, on a call, as my iPhone 4 remained on the counter.  So, not really a CON--these are designed for music first, phone calls second--keep that in mind. If you want both, these are still the best solution I've found and they are a good solution, at that.  Not perfect, but very good.  In a 'normal' car, I think they would sound fine, but may not be practical when driving...(watch out for cops--shouldn't be wearing headphones while driving:)...UPDATE/FYI 5/22/2011:  Headphones stopped charging for a couple of days--plugged it in and no light would come on and it was not charged after being plugged in all night.  Tried plugging it into a pc and got the same--no charging light (briefly flashes, then goes off).  Then, I tried it again (15 minutes later) with the PC and it started charging...so, I tried using the AC plug again and it's now charging normally/light is on, etc.  Not sure WHAT that was...I still love these headphones and I used them constantly.  Hoping that continues. It could be something with the AC charger...SUMMARYOverall, I can still HIGHLY recommend these, after using them extensively for the past 5 months--haven't tested in the heat or when working out heavily (heard it has issues with sweat...), but for my purposes--a 3 hour daily train commute, walking in NYC and working around the house, they work fantastic.  The sound is amazing and the fit is almost perfect.  Using the large ear buds (comes with 3 sizes) seems to also help drown out misc. external noise, which is nice.  I've heard these are better sounding than the newer version, the S10-HD, but can't confirm.  They're also cheaper and well worth the money.</text>

        <text>These headsets sound great. My problem with them is due to my usage. I use these when I go running or I'm at the gym and I tell you they are terrible for that. It starts off okay but then as you move, the bottom &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; button becomes very VERY sensitive and gets pressed when it bounces off the back of my neck or back. This has a domino effect in that, suddenly the volume goes to the max or the track skips. Lately I've noticed, it hates the charging also. When I plug it in, it may or may not charge. I like the idea but the execution is terrible. I would not recommend it. I'll use it until it dies and will just simply buy something else.</text>

        <text>I am a runner and have been using these headphones for the past four years with different devices on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors. Currently I use them with my iPhone 4S, with which this headset paired effortlessly. However I am now on my third headset.After about a year the battery did not seem to be holding a charge, and I got a replacement headset. I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues, though I have no idea how widespread that is.Soon after getting that replacement I started going to a gym where the treadmill area was not well ventilated and tended to be humid. I got drenched in sweat and so did the headset. The volume control stopped working (it was stuck on the highest volume) and there was static coming out of one of the ear buds. Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be "zapped" by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant. It appears that this headset is not. It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my first gym. I have since switched gyms, and my new gym is well ventilated. I also wear the Buff (which I have reviewed on Amazon) when I run. Since this covers my entire head and is great for absorbing sweat, including sweat on the back of my neck,  the sweat is no longer an issue for me.Note: If you want a corded headset to use when sweat will be an issue, I suggest the Sennheiser PMX 70, which I have reviewed on Amazon.In any event, my latest headset has been working just fine for the past three years.Before purchasing this headset, you should keep some things in mind.First, depending on what device you use, it may be necessary to buy a separate blue tooth adapter (I had to do that when I used this headset with an iPod).Second, if you wear glasses, it works best to put the headset on first and the glasses on second. The glasses won't fit quite as snugly as they normally do, but for exercise it will be fine. I found that if I put my sunglasses on first, the headset did not fit as snugly in my ears, with a resulting loss in sound. The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana--put the headset on first.Third, since the headset is curved in the back, if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back, the collar will push against the headset, which will come slightly out of its position in your ears. So wearing the headset with a ski jacket won't work very well. With a thinner collar, you will occasionally have to reposition the headset as the collar pushes against it. Also, if you wear a ski hat to run, you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth, because of the back of the neck design, you will not be able to use this headset comfortably to lay on your back (like on a blanket at the beach, a couch in your den, a chaise lounge by the pool) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back (like in a car or airplane). Likewise you will need to remove it to use certain equipment at the gym, like the situp bench.All in all I am very satisfied with this product now that I have resolved the sweat issue.Update March 17, 2012: I figured out how to use this headset comfortably to lay on my back. Turn the headset upside down (So the M now looks like a W), put it in back of your head, and put the earbuds into your ears without looping anything over your hears like you usually do. The back of the headset will now be flush against your neck, and you can comfortably lay back on a beach chair etc. Keep in mind that now the phone button and volume controls will be on your right ear instead of your left ear. I can't believe that I didn't think of this sooner.</text>

        <text>Pro's:Sound good.Great for workout since it won't fall out of your ears.Works with iPhone.  Can stream live radio (Pandora) while working out.Works well even if you are sweating a lot working out.Blocks external sounds.  Since it fits your ears snuggly it blocks outside sounds.Great for the car.  iPhone Users - hear GPS commands, listen to music (ipod or Pandora), talk on the phone while you are drivingiPhone users - control volume from iphone or from buttons on earpieceThe newest one seems to be pretty sweat proof.Charges pretty quickly and easily thru USB cable.Cons:iPhone - buttons for controlling music are not compatible with the iphoneI wish the removalbe ear pods were 1/2 as hard to take off as they were to put on.  When not in your ears, these things pop off all the time.  Plan on getting extra for when you lose them.  Kind of a pain.Good sound but tends to focus on high end and low end response.  The mid range seems to be a little weak.  But this HD version of this headset definately sounds better than the older none HD version.Will not work if you lean back in a chair or if you lean you neck back against head rest in a car.  The way the headset sits behind your neck is nice accept if you want to lean back or lay back while listening to music.</text>

        <text>Just ordered both this, and a similar pair by Nokia. Both appear to have the same issue with mic placement which makes them virtually useless for use as a phone headset unless you are in a very quiet area. As for listening to music, I love these.  The only two flaws I see are that these are not adjustable at all, and the mic placement and quality. As I'm using this primarily for listening to music, I'm glad I got these. If these last a decent time for the cost, i won't mind buying a replacement pair.</text>

        <text>I got Motorola S9-HD for a week now because I did not want to deal with wired headphones while running. The product I have received came in original box with authenticity hologram attached to the arm.The short of it is that when it works, it does the job great and sound quality is very good. Contrary to other reviewers, I have a pretty comfortable fit. Pairing is also very easy. I like the button placement etc. I had it paired with both my laptop and a iPod nano wireless transmitter (i10s (Luxurious White) Tiny Bluetooth iPod Transmitter for iPod/iPhone/iPad/iTouch).I have a couple other Bluetooth headphones but they were not suitable for active sports. While this one does better job of staying on my head, there is a big annoying problem with signal cut-offs. S9-HD frequently loose signal with the transmitter. I cannot keep the iPod reliably in my pocket. I have to hold it in my hand. I thought the issue was with my wireless transmitter but these headphones do the same with my laptop when I am sitting directly in front of the laptop and also my other Bluetooth headphones do not cut-off this frequently, at such a short distance.Edit: The cut-offs seems to be less when both iPod and S9-HD are fully charged. When battery starts to drain over time (say an hour or so) the cut-offs become more often. Either the battery is too small or not fully charging fully (or both). Perhaps, with a few more charge/discharge cycles the situation may improve. I'll update this review if I see an improvement.Edit2: The cut-offs are continuing after over a month use. It is such an annoyance and probably a flaw of this device as my other bluetooth devices does not have this problem. Unfortunately, besides Motorola S9 and S10, the other Bluetooth headphones are not suitable for active sports.</text>

        <text>After reading the reviews on this and the S10 I got the S9 and was not disappointed. I use this at work to listen to music/ books and I need free hands no cord tethering me to my ipad2 or smart phone. It works like a champ all day. my longest use was 6.5 hours and I have not yet found out when the battery will die. the range is great line of sight (about 250-300 feet) but every wall drops the distance by a factor of 4.The volume out of this unit is great! at work the background noise is on the edge of needing earplugs but this keeps up while blocking some of the background noise. I can still hear coworkers which is a must but it blocks out the other noise.I have had no issue changing the blue tooth paring from my android phone to the ipad2 and back.the only con is that you cannot tip your head back with these on. So no using them in bed when laying on your back. even in a chair it tends to dislodge the ear buds.</text>

        <text>The LG Dare was my first smartphone and I loved it until I "graduated" to an even smarter phone, and gave the Dare to my husband, who had tired of his old phone. Recently, his Verizon contract came up for renewal, whereby he was eligible for a new phone at a discounted price (with a 2-year contract of course), but he refused to give up his Dare, in spite of its being all beat up (he had chosen to not use screen or phone covers while he had it). He was adamant about keeping his Dare, saying it did all he wanted it to do, it was the right size and feel, etc., etc. He also did not want to spend the extra money on a data plan he wasn't going to use (we both have plenty of computer access otherwise) so a smartphone was out.  Since I'm the "geeky" one in this family I did the research on feature (aka "dumb") phones he might like, and unfortunately the pickings were quite slim...it's obvious that the phone companies, or at least Verizon, are moving towards having very few feature phones, if any.  Desperate, I came to amazon--which is where I come first whenever I want to buy something. Not expecting to find it, I looked for and found the Dare through this seller.  The phone appeared to be brand new and we immediately had it activated at Verizon without any problems.  Plus: my husband is not locked into a 2-year plan! This time my husband agreed to a case and screen cover which I also bought through amazon.  My husband is very happy with this purchase,and I hope it will last him at least a couple more years. I should mention that the phone IS internet capable if that's something you do want. The only reason I am giving this item 4 stars is because the cover on the SD slot of the phone was loose.  My husband played around with it finally getting it to fit it, but we're not sure what will happen when he needs to open it again, if it will open or if it is stuck, etc.  This won't be a major problem since more than likely he won't be using the sd card on the phone for his pictures.  I complained to the seller about this and received a response within 24 hours.  By then the problem had been solved by my husband, but I appreciated the seller's willingness to help and satisfy me, the customer. So, the problem is not with the seller, but with a small defect of the phone itself.  I would not hesitate to buy again from this seller, and who knows, maybe in a few years my husband will want yet another Dare!</text>

        <text>I've only been using this charger for a few days, so it's too early to tell whether it will hold up. However, I'm pleased with it. Considering the low price, even if it doesn't last long, it's a decent deal. Interestingly, the charger I received looks slightly different than what's pictured. The main difference is that the LED light on mine is long and narrow, rather than a single LED point as shown in the photo. Also, the LED on mine is neon blue when no battery is inserted and a bright pink when charging. Kind of cool looking for a cheap device.Anyway, it's light, compact, cheap, and works. It is not fast, however. I noted that it seems to take a completely discharged battery about 5-6 hours to fully charge in this device.Overall, if it lasts even 6 months, I'll be fairly pleased (considering the low price). I may get another one as a backup.I would note, however, that an OEM Blackberry external charger can be bought on Amazon for roughly two to three times the price of this one (but would likely be faster and more durable).</text>

        <text>I purchased this in order to make my sirius xm radio for my car able to work in my house without buying all their fancy home kit set-up stuff, but the darn thing wouldn't keep my radio on, it would start for a quick second and then turn off again. I have no idea why, and I am not electrical/computer wiz so I can't really comment if it was the voltage or what that caused this (even though I blamed the voltage in the subject line). I never tried this product with anything else, like a car charger in the house or anything like that, so I also can't comment on how it works for that, but I do know it sadly didn't work for what I was hoping to accomplish. Aside from all that however, the shipping and transaction and all that went very smoothly and I have no complaints there. :)</text>

        <text>I bought this phone from amazon three days before thanksgiving. It arrived the day before neatly packaged and undamaged (brand new) in the box. At first I was not familiar with all the functions and keys but I spent the night figuring everything. Right out of the package I inserted my sim card, battery and the phone fired up right away.Pros:Good size phone with a good solid feel. I especially like the feedback from the screen when you touch or use the stylus which folds neatly into the bottom of the phone. The package includes a transparent cover for protecting the screen. Do not be put of by earlier reviews! It does have all the MMS features found on other phones. I loaded the included software and from LG's site, I was able to download the newest firmware update which speeds up the phone and opens all the features. The latest software is kp500_v10o. Calls sound good and i was able to text, browse and e mail with a few adjustments in the software. There are several web sites out there with configuaration info and there seem to be droves of people who like this phone.......you cant beat the price for what it does and how good it looks.Cons - It should come with more apps but i will remedy that very shortly,this is a minor nuisance. One other thing, LG USA does not have any information nor will they help with the phone even though it bears their name. I could not get help to access the USB driver from them. Thanks to the many "friends" in cyber space i was able to find it in short order.I ordered the case, a protective cover and a extra screen protector because i plan on keeping this as long as i did my last phone..........5 years. Times are hard and the rent is too damn high.....can't replace phones every few months like some folks!I highly reccomend this phone if you are in the market.</text>

        <text>I have not tried all the various functions of this phone, but it seems to work for everything I need it to do.  I don't like the round prongs power plug, but I had an adapter since I have lived in Shanghai for the past several years. I think the user interface is simply horrible to use.  The various functions are needlessly buried in layers of senseless options.  Try to make a call to a company that says press 1 for English, 2 for Spanish, etc.  You have to press and hold the touch screen area called unlock. Then you have to press another area to get a touch screen numeral pad.  By the time you get to this point, the number you called is asking you if you want to repeat the options. The microprocessor in this phone must be the slowest on earth. Everything is so slow and counterintuitive that I get upset everytime I use it. In text mode, they use the same layout as a digital phone. Why they didn't have the option of a Qwerty keyboard is beyond logic.  So there you are pressing every button once, twice or three times when it could have been a full keyboard layout. It does have the option where it tries to guess the word you are spelling, which is good. The phone is usable, but frustrating to use in my opinion.  I tried to give it to my brother, but he returned it to me saying it has the worst user interface in the world and he wouldn't take it even if I paid him money.</text>

        <text>The LG KP500 is adequate if you are using it primarily for phone calls, email, Web browsing, and text-messaging. However, it does have a few problems/limitations:Touchscreen: This phone uses a resistive touchscreen as opposed to a capacitive touchscreen. The touchscreen isn't very responsive at times, which is a real annoyance. (Capacitive touchscreens, such as those on the iPhone and Blackberry Storm, are more responsive and support multi-touch gestures.)Homescreen: You can only add/remove a predefined set of widgets on the Homescreen: Calendar, Clock/Alarm, Notes, Music Player, Picture Viewer, Social Networking (My Space, Twitter, Facebook), and International Time.Single-Axis Accelerometer: The keyboard doesn't always change to a full QWERTY keyboard when you change the orientation of the phone from vertical to horizontal.Web Browser: Browsing the Web using the built-in Web Browser is a frustrating experience. The links on a page don't load at least half the time when you click on them. The page also takes a while to refresh after it's been scrolled. I downloaded and installed Opera Mini, which works flawlessly.Email: The phone can store only 300 email messages. Once the capacity is reached, you have to delete existing emails from the Inbox in order to retrieve more emails. Deleting emails is a hassle: you have to (1) select and delete emails from the Inbox (deleted emails are then placed in the Deleted folder) and (2) navigate to the Deleted folder and delete the emails again before they are finally expunged.Syncing With Outlook: I am able to sync with Outlook on my PC only through USB, not bluetooth. I get a "Pairing setting is failed while connecting with the device [sic]" error message with bluetooth syncing. The To Do list is barely functional -- there is no way to sort it and the subject field is only about 14 characters wide. Calendar and To Do List are limited to 500 items.FM Radio: The FM Radio only works with the earbuds (included) plugged in. The earbuds use a proprietary LG connector, not a standard 3.5mm audio plug. The sound from the earbuds is tinny.Camera &amp; Video: The camera has no autofocus, much less zoom capability. The camera is best used for close-up shots (distant objects are blurry). The video is very choppy because of the low frame rate (12 fps).---There you have it. The above are some important considerations you might want to take into account before making a purchase decision.</text>

        <text>I have been looking for a new phone for the last year, since my old T-Mobile Blast was becoming outdated. So, when I took a trip to Germany and found the LG KP500 there, I was quite curious. I looked up reviews here on Amazon, and after some consideration, bought the phone from a German electronics retailer... And I am sure glad that I did!Let's get started with the Pros and the Cons of this phone.PROS:-Unlocked, Quadband World Phone.-Inexpensive. I bought the phone for 89, which is comparable to the price here on Amazon.-Good Quality. Although the phone is small and made of plastic, it has an extremely durable feel.-Signal Quality. I normally have no signal with T-Mobile's To-Go plan in my house, but I usually have at least 3 bars with this phone. By comparison, my last three phones constantly lost signal in my house.-Great features. Many features, including a Movie editor, 3MP Camera, Music Player, Video Recorder, Games, Accelerometer, and drawing pad.-Stylus. Not really necessary, but it really helps with texting and making notes.-Multiple Apps and Task Manager. You can run more than one app at a time, like Music Player and Camera-Widgets. On the home page, there is a selection of widgets to choose from. These include: Music Player, World Clock, Clock, Calender, FM Radio, and Notepad.-Speed Dial Widgets. With a swipe of the finger, the home page changes to a speed dial home page with up to 10 contacts and images.-Downloadable Apps and Games. The phone is Java based, so you can download .JAR apps from a number of sites to transfer to the phone.-Expandable Memory via microSD slot (Up to 8gb)CONS:-The interface, while very sleek and refined, can become slow due to multiple apps running at once.-Texting in QWERTY format is a bet annoying at first, due to the small keyboard. But after a while, you get used to it.My recommendation: If you are looking for a new, unlocked phone at a cheap price, the LG KP500 is for you.NOTE: I own the silver version of this phone, which doesn't have the rubbery texture.UPDATE 10/2010-The phone is still working great. I actually received an update from T-Mobile to allow MMS messaging and internet web-browsing, so the phone is actually better now than it was 6 months ago! Plus, after accidentally dropping it face first into concrete, it still works with no scratches! So that is another plus!</text>

        <text>I had a clear case for about a month until the belt clip attachment broke off.  The rubberized surface of this case is very nice, and the screw for belt clip attachment is much better as well.  Still, having learned my lesson I set the screw in with superglue just to make sure it never unscrews again, and the belt clip attachment is rock solid now.  I also like the unobstructed access to the buttons and scroll wheel.Also, the clear case used to press buttons on the keyboard when i would slide the phone open, but this case doesn't do that.

        <text>Beside the fact that this case adds bulk to an already bulky phone, I find the back of the case REALLY difficult to remove when I want to change the battery.The case does fit well and I have no problem using the phone with the case on. It feels like a nice case, especially for the price. I just didn't like the added bulk, even though I kept the case on for protection. When I needed to change the battery (I carry extra, charged battery for emergencies) it was SOOOO hard to remove the case, I was afraid I'd break the phone. I decided not to put the case back on, once I was able to get it off.</text>

        <text>I'm not sure what is going on with all the high ratings, but I was sent a flimsy plastic case that was painted, poorly, black on the outside and white on the inside - plastic as well. This will quickly scratch the phone and has nothing to prevent plastic-on-plastic scratching. Of course, this is what you get for ~$8.00 (cost plus shipping) I suppose, but you need to think twice before purchase if you want your $200 or $500 phone (depending on contract or not) scratched in days.By the way, there is not a single thing rubber about this. Absolute false advertisement. I might have been sent the wrong item, but the invoice and package do not indicate that.</text>

        <text>I also have a pod I use for an 8120 I purchased from a T-Mobile store and the finish on it is highly polished chrome. This pod does not have the same finish but a cheaper, dull looking chrome. I found, like other reviewers that the front Blackberry logo does not light up when your phone is inserted and charging. According to the Blackberry website it is supposed to. I suspect this is a knockoff. This pod is will charge your 8900.</text>
    </sentence>
    <sentence id="8072">
        <text>I bought this on an auction site.  However its the same product.  It is really well made and will not tilt over since it feels solid.I was really pleased at the automatic bedside mode feature where the clock comes on when its in this cradle (It comes on when you plug in the blackberry the normal way as well, so its more of the Curve 8900's feature then the cradles) so it makes for a great bedside clock.  The light that's on this pod is also very useful when you want to place it on the cradle at night.Of course the only issue is that if you buy a crystal cover to protect your blackberry you can't really use this since you have to take the cover off every time you want to put it on this charging pod, so a silicone cover may be better if you want to use this since it can be slipped off easily.Your existing charger's USB connector plugs into this device.I enjoy using this especially with Slacker Radio, Flycast and other applications that can consume quite a bit of battery power, so it also works as my desktop radio, MP3 player etc.An overall comment on the 8900, its really an amazing device. It has replaced my ipod, my GPS receiver, my radio, my alarm clock, and even my Archos video player.</text>

        <text>HI All,This is a must have item if you own or are planning on buying a Blackberry 8900 (javelin).  Why you ask?Simple....RIM decided to change the charging connector on the 8900 to Micro-USB....it is no longer Mini-USB.  To me it annoying to fiddle around with and get the connector in properly....its very thin and orientation is key.  I primarily use this dock in my bedroom and sometimes its dark in there....dark enough that I dont need to mess with wires and damage connectors..etc.  The doc makes it easy to drop the blackberry in for charging.You simply connect the micro-usb ac adapter to the dock....and drop your BB in for charging at any given time.

        <text>There's nothing wrong with this charger, there's just better options.  With as many devices as we all have to charge these days, and the standardization to USB type chargers, there's little reason any more to buy a unit like this, one outlet taken up, and it can only charge one device, and it better be an old Samsung phone.  Once you replace your phone, it becomes waste.  Better option if you still have one of those old Samsung phones to charge is to get a standard USB charger, and buy one of the OEM type Samsung charging cables, which can be had for only a few bucks, and you can charge off any USB type charger, buy three and keep one at your computer, one in the car (half of the charging cords I buy now have extra usb outlets) and where ever it is your phone ends up laying for the night, surely you have an extra USB charger laying around from some other obsolete piece you don't use any more.

        <text>If you search for Micro HDMI in the search, this Mini HDMI is your top result. A little frustrating, my own fault for not seeing that it was exactly what I was after, but also that this is the top result for search that was for a micro not mini. On top of that, I chose the one from SF planet who had a good rating, and paid for standard shipping, instead of the one that offered free super saver shipping,  to get it a little faster, on 6-14, and I still didn't get it until today, 6-22.

        <text>I recently used this cord with myFlip MinoHD Camcorder  2nd Generation, 2 Hours (Brushed Metal)and it made my little camera 1000x better.

        <text>I made the leap into the smartphone world, coming off an old flip-LG phone that I *loved*.  I wasn't sure I'd even really like the BlackBerry, as it's a bar phone and I always chose flip models, but I love it.  Sure, the Javelin doesn't have 3G, but for most things, the EDGE network is perfectly fast and 3G isn't so much faster that I miss it for web browsing.Call Quality - in all honesty, I don't call much on the phone, but it gets plenty loud and I can usually hear calls just fine.  It doesn't drop calls unless my service sputters (ATT), but overall I have no complaints.Keypad - On this, I'm much pickier.  I love the QWERTY keyboard on this model.  My work phone is a BlackBerry World Edition 8830, whose keys are much more similar to the Bold and Tour.  I don't like those keypads as much.  There was, of course, a slight learning curve on the Javelin in typing time, but now typing is a breeze.  I type an awful lot on Gchat, via SMS, and via BlackBerry messenger, and I have no problem with the keys.  They're great, they're separated, and I don't often make a mistake on them.Trackball - I cannot praise this trackball enough.  RIM finally did away with the old recessed trackballs and created one that feels smooth and effortless.  I love it.Media player - I didn't actually expect to use this, but I lost my mp3 player.  I popped in an 8 gb microSDHC card (didn't have to remove the battery - nice feature), loaded up some music, and popped in earbuds.  Music doesn't sound so phenomenal that audiophiles would be happy with it, but to me it sounded perfectly acceptable.  Videos and pictures look spectacular on the display, and there's a playlist option for music.  All in all, pretty impressive for a phone meant for email.Display - Gorgeous.  Absolutely flawless.  Pictures look amazing, it's a pleasure to look at the screen.Connectivity - Again, no 3G on this device.  Unless you need to use data while talking on the phone, you won't miss it.Speaker - LOUD.  Not awesome sounding, but better than most mp3 players' built in speakers.Reasons why it gets 4 starts instead of 5 - MicroUSB, why?  Why remove the miniUSB that SO much of my other electronics have?  I hope I don't lose the charger . . . It can be a little laggy occasionally.  It's tough to find good accessories for this particular model.  It was $150 with a contract, why no accessories?  It should be much easier to find a good skin and screen protectors.All in all, the device is fantastic.  It's smaller than the Bold and the Tour, the screen is outrageously good, and it's a pleasure to type on.  I'd highly recommend it.</text>

        <text>I love the phone, its light and has good functionality. I really love the trackball. The applications are good enough for a business person (at least to me, being a graduate student).

        <text>First I have owned and used a lot of BlackBerrys.  I started with the 7100, and have moved up from there to use the 8700, 8800, 8100, 8300, 8310, 8320, and now my 8900.  I have also used a Storm 1 some as well.The 8900 is an amazing phone.  Its fast and snappy.  I don't have the constant problem of running low on memory I had with my 8320.  The WiFi is great when I am somewhere with weak signal, or best of all on an airplane equipped with WiFi.  I was able to surf, IM, and Tweet the entire flight.  I have never had a flight feel so short.The phone is a nice size to fit in my hand for typing or calling.  The keypad is great and I have no issues typing on it.The only complaint I have in the design is the placement of the charging port.  It is a little inconvenient to hold and charge, but you learn to work around it.I have no complaint about the memory card slot being under the battery.  I don't have a need to change it.By far this is my favorite BlackBerry I have used and would recommend it.  It works perfect for heavy email, texting, and messaging that I do.</text>

        <text>HI All.I have used a blackberry for over 10 years now...give or take. I have always been impressed by the devices they have created in the past and the current line of devices. Since I like to be on the bleeding edge of tech, I just had to get a 8900.Most of you know by now what the new feature sets are of blackberries that are out today. The bold, the storm, and now this one The JAVELIN.I wont go into too much detail but I will give you my quick run down.The Javelin is perhaps the thinnest, lightest, small footprint blackberry that I have ever used. It sports a great look and the feel to the hands is awesome. It is after all the curve II. Screen comparison to the bold is that this unit has a higher resolution then the bold but a smaller physical screen. The higher resolution definitely adds some clarity to the screen...but it should be duly noted that the BOLD's screen is also beautiful. Yes I own both.The Javelin is a EDGE/Wi-FI device...it does not have 3G capabilities. Technically you only need 3G if you want to be on the phone and receive/send emails at the same time when using your mobile connections...I personally have never needed that functionality. However, please note that if you are connected to WI-FI you are able to be on a telephone call and receive/send email etc over wi-fi....works perfectly.The Javelin has a new processor which makes the device FLY. Yes the processor is slower then the one in the Bold, but one can hardly tell the difference....I have used both for weeks...and I can honestly say you will not notice the speed difference.I have a 8gb MicroSD card installed in the device and use the software available from blackberry to synchronize all of my DRM free music from iTunes to the Blackberry. A must buy if you want to carry one device that does it all. Amazon has great prices on micro-sd cards.....Here are what I consider to be the best features on the Javelin:1. AUTOFOCUS 3.2mp Camera - It is AWESOME. Picture taking, due to focus, is a bit slower....however, the clarity and quality of the picture make it all worthwhile.2. FOOTPRINT - Great looking device with a great size.3. High Resolution screen - Awesome clarity....4. The functionality of a blackberry has always been a pro..and this one makes it better with a faster processor and more zippy feel.The three BAD things:1. The speaker on this thing is so TINNY....that it hurts my ears with certain tones.....there is NO bass what so ever. That is to be expected in a device this small....so maybe some new tones need to be tested out.2. Micro-USB - Why take something like mini-usb and replace it with something new. Now I have to get all new chargers, travel chargers, etc.... Upsetting but bareable.3. The holster in the BOX is simply a pleather pouch of sorts...no belt clip etc... You will need to buy an aftermarket leather/plastic holster if you wish to attach to your belt. Not a deal breaker...but should be mentioned.I am posting some images for your review also.Overall this is a great 5 Star Device.</text>

I bought a N1 pouch a little while ago because I thought it might be the same quality and a good size for my phones. But I was wrong. G1 pouch still wins hands down. Great pouch, super cheap.

        <text>Ratchet failed after a few weeks. Bought another, failed again. Also, data communication is not reliable; became worse over time. "zipcord" ratchet was better, but its data capacity also deteriorates over time. But both of these charge the phone just fine. Data communication works perfectly with a short non-retracting cable with Gold-plated plugs, so I believe the cause of my problem is dust or cold solder on my laptop's USB socket.

        <text>I purchased this as a backup charging cable for phones, to use other USB based chargers lying around the house.  So far, no problems.  It performs as expected, with no problems. I have not tried it for data.It seems less robust than others I've owned, but not incredibly cheesy.  The cable will stop at varying lengths, but to retract it must be extended to full length.  Max length is relatively short.</text>

        <text>This perfectly portable USB Micro cord is 31 inches from end to end when fully extended. (So plan on 28")It is fairly well designed. There is just enough tension so that it 'sticks' (like a tape measure when you lock it) automatically.Compared to the Belkin retractable cords that I own, the Amzer cord does appear a little bit loose. Time will tell (and I will update this review), if this tell-tale sign proves ominous or benign (hence the 4 stars).Note: the "Micro" USB differs from the Mini USB. Make sure you are getting what you want. The Micro is smaller and tends to fit BlueTooth ear-sets and other small devices; the Mini is usually for portable hard drives.This is the first Amzer product I have purchased. I would have bought a Belkin, but I could not find a Micro USB from them.</text>

        <text>Cable connection is not good and will damage your devices.seems to charge ok, but so does if you get a good cable, and keep inserting-removing from the USB port... the phone will not even flash the charging state if you are fast enough, and that's what happens with this cable. for data i keep get reconnects all the time to the point it's impossible to transfer one large file. which proves the connectivity and continuity in the cable or connectors sucks big time. tested 2 cables.No phone shows you micro disconnects on charging, you may not even not it's flashing on and off.will not even bother returning. will probably use the spring mechanism for other cables i have around, but this one i wouldn't use to connect to my expensive phones. at all.</text>

        <text>Besides being a retractable USB cable for the sake of portability, the thin cable is much lighter and more flexible than regular USB cables, which makes it a little easier to handle connected devices when tethered. I can count the number of cable jams when retracting on one finger (1), but that could just be because I'm usually careful to slowly wind it up instead of letting go of the ends. The micro-USB end of my cable is a little bent from use, and it remains to be seen how long before wire fatigue causes a short.</text>

        <text>For the traveler and even the stay-at-home, retractable cables are the way to go.With microUSB connectors well on their way to becoming a de facto standard, I needed new retractable cables with these connectors.Amzer is a packager with a large line of products manufactured by others. So far, the products I have purchased under their name have been of modest quality, but durable.This cable is 32 inches long, somewhat shorter than cables offered by others such as Tripp-lite. Construction seems on a par with comparable units. In other words, treat it very carefully and you'll probably get fairly long use out of it. It has a one-year guaranty for whatever worth that may have.The microUSB connecter has a thicker than usual cover. This will cause problems if your connector has a collar of any kind. For example, if your smartphone is in a case and the case surrounds the microUSB connector closely, you may have a problem with this cable.Other than caveat, this is a well-priced, reasonably durable unit.Jerry</text>

I have had mine for over two years and it is doing fine.The wire on the reel can get out of place, but it takes very little to untangle it....a few gentle pulls all the way out and let it all the way back in, and it slowly sets the wire correctly on the reel.This is great product...useful, the connectors seat tight in your unit and it seems to last.</text>

        <text>This product came in s small ziplok bag with only one set of ear buds, in the picture and in the description it lists multiple sizes.  I bought 2 of these at the time I placed my order and neither had the various sizes of earbuds.  Other than that, they fit ok and sound decent.</text>

        <text>I was somewhat surprised the RIM included a pair of these earphones with the phone since my old earphones did not fit. At first I was not happy with the fit because they kept falling out of my ears (similar to other complaints here), but then I switched to the small size ear pieces (they come with 3 sizes) and they fit perfectly and stay in until I take them out. I am an average size man and never thought I had small ears, so I was surprised that the smallest ear pieces fit best. I think that one of the problems people may be having is either not trying the smaller ear pieces or because even the smallest are still too large.I think that the sound is excellent. While I have not tried a very expensive set (Bose) I have used a lot of sets from various electronics and sets I have purchased independently. These are by far the best pair of earphones I have used in terms of sound quality and comfort. The rubber earpiece really cuts down on outside noise so I wouldn't use them while driving or if you need to hear other things. But if you want to simply listen to music or talk on the phone, these are great.They have a control button that you can press to mute the sound. It also ends the call if you are talking on the phone (and once the call is over the music starts back up).</text>

        <text>The Blackberry Original Stereo Headset HDW-15766-005 which I ordered here on Amazon, and which was sent to me by CELLULAR 5 STAR is EXACTLY the headset that I have always wanted for my Blackberry.I listen to my Blackberry all day.  I listen to music and news podcast mp3s on it while: commuting, at the gym, at work, etc.  I prefer a wired headset to make calls as well.  All I care about, is that I can hear the sound from them, and that I don't lose sound in one ear, and that the volume carries well.  That's all I care about from the audio from my mobile phone, and these perform beautifully!The headset has a nice, thick cord which resists all attempts at tangling and crimping (the leading cause of losing the sound in one earbud). The buds themselves are well crafted and fit in the ear well (and come with small, medium and large pads to fit your ear).  The connector is a right angle plug, and the jack is a 3.5mm format, exactly what my Blackberry 8330 Curve calls for.Excellent.  I am most likely going to stock up on these, as I go through headsets like they are on fire!</text>

        <text>I work from home most days. And most days, I have 4-8 hours of conference calls. Traditional in-ear bluetooth sets not only hurt my ear canal, but they also didn't have the battery life to make it all day. So I went on the search for an over-the-head set that had an extended battery life. Additionally, I wanted to make sure my coworkers could hear me clearly, for obvious reasons. I thought perhaps a wired headset was going to be my answer before I found the BlueParrott.This headset is great - the battery lasts forever. I charge it once per week, meaning I get 24-32 hours of talk time. I can always hear, and my coworkers were shocked to hear I was on a bluetooth. They said I was easy to hear and no background noise came through.The headset is easy to operate, with an on/off button, and volume up and down buttons. To mute, simply hold one of the volume buttons until the unit beeps. It will beep once every 10-15 sec while muted.Highly recommend if you spend a significant amount of your day on the phone like I do!</text>

        <text>I've owned the BlueParrott B250-XT headset for 13 months.  The headset has stopped working.  It charges, but will not turn on.  Tech Support just told me very nicely that I was one month out of warranty, but they would repair it for $55 plus postage.  Considering I paid just $71 for it new, that seems like a rip-off to me.On the other hand, the headset is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, has excellent sound quality and volume on both ends, and holds a charge really well.  I.e., this was a really great headset while it lasted.I may grit my teeth and just get another one of these, or I may switch to something else.

        <text>I really do like this headset. I just wish the audio quality was a little higher and less muffled sounding. The reception on this thing is amazing.

Usually I get static on other BT headsets at 15 feet away.I use this for my computer to record product demos using my BT on my laptop, so this headset doubles as a computer microphone headset that would be great for Skype (Skype recognized it right away) and any recording that needs to be done on the computer - maybe it could even be good for gaming. The noise-reduction is top-notch as well.I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a BT headset with a boom microphone, great noise reduction, a clear signal, and long battery life.</text>

        <text>If you are like me, you research and research and try to avoid any problems before buying an item like this so you don't have to waste time with return shipping and you can get on with things.  So let me lay it all down here and save you a bit of trouble and touch on the important issues.COMFORT  - I hate hate hate HATE with a passion, earpieces that fit into the ear like ear buds or other bluetooth devices.  Sure, they look cool and I too, like to pretend I am Lieutenant Uhura answering a distress call from Regula Space Station but For the life of me, I cannot figure out how ANYONE thinks it is actually comfortable.  This is a headset.....sure, it is bulky in comparison but in my home office or a car without a bluetooth speaker, who the hell cares what it looks like.  The padding on the ear is very comfortable and the whole headset stays put and doesn't slide off.The only issue i had was a little soreness on the ear when I wear it too long AND I have glasses on.  But I don't wear it until I have a call now so that problem solved itself.RANGE - I haven't tested this out yet but i can move freely in my work area and not lose reception - I've never tested the 66' range but how often do you really go 66 feet away from your phone?SOUND QUALITY - on a scale from 1-10 I give this an 11.  I can hear the caller loud and clear and they can hear me just fine.  Most people do not even know I am on a bluetooth.  How bout that!!!!NOISE CANCELLATION -  YES, this actually works.  I have no idea how this technology works to cancel out the wind and other crap but picks up &amp;#34;important&amp;#34; sounds other than my voice - could it be magic?  Could it be voodou? (no I spelled it correctly, voodoo is incorrect) could it be the work of space aliens?  Could be be who cares because it works and works well.BATTERY LIFE -  this last a LONG fricken time between charges - even when i forget to turn it off when I leave the house without it.  I think I charge 2 times a week with moderate use.  BUT when the battery dies, it doesn't hang up on your caller.  Nice!CUSTOMER SUPPORT - This is one of those companies that runs their business as it should.  First I'll say that this is NOT my first headset.  The first headset I got from them started malfunctioning so i called in and they said to just send it back.  They'd repair it or replace it if repairs were impossible.  I think they told me half the truth and just sent out a new one since I had a headset back in my possession rather quickly but the bottom line is that i was not out my headset for very long.  THAT headset lasted two years...maybe longer - I think.....hell, I dunno....it was a long time ago.Anyway, that first one died when I went into battle with a spider in my kitchen and in my panic the headset was flung into a sink with a used stockpot full of soapy water.  I immediately plunged the headset into a bowl of rubbing alcohol (yes, I keep copious amounts of this stuff on hand for cleaning since it works better on glass AND is a lot cheaper AND it USUALLY works on electronics that have gotten wet...but really, I shouldn't have to justify that purchase to you)  I'd be willing to bet it may have worked if it had just been water but i think there was red sauce in there too and most electronics won't function well on marinara with garlic and artichoke hearts.ADJUSTABLE - It fits my medium head as well as my husband's 'larger&amp;#34; head (if i said BIG head here he'd take it the wrong way....he has a healthy ego and is NOT overbearing in anyway.  He is also a great cook, has an Emmy and NO, you don't have a shot at him so look but don't touch) and it also adjusts to fit my 8 year old in the rare event i can get her on the phone to talk to her grandparents....I am counting my blessings though that she is not fused to a phone yet.....so not looking forward to the teen years.DURABILITY - It takes a fair amount of abuse - afterall, it was designed for truckers so you can take it off and toss it down onto the table and take off down the street to catch up with the ice cream truck when needed.  Word of warning, it will NOT function with spaghetti sauce in the earpiece.  Do not submerge this in soup, drawn butter, marinara, reduction, chowder or any other liquid.  Do not use this in the shower.COMPATIBILITY - I have used this with an iPhone (3, 3S &amp; 5), a Sony Ericsson Experia, Samsung Infuse and Samsung Galaxy Note.  All worked perfectly with this headsetCONS - You WILL indeed look like a Wendy's drive thru operator or Judy from Time Life Books when wearing this.  Expect silly comments from warped spouses or co-workers.BOTTOM LINE.....if you do not want to violate your ear canal or have something looped over the top of your ear feeling like it is going to fall off, get this headset.  And if you have a problem with it, the company will stand behind their product.</text>

        <text>After reading rave reviews, I got this to use while driving in a convertible (as my other bluetooth picks up too much wind to work well), and also at home with my land line so I can work and talk.  The sound is definitely excellent for me and the person on the other end; the earpiece is fairly comfortable, although I have to move it around from time to time; the battery is very long lasting; and the weight is not too bad in spite of how it looks.  My biggest problem with this style of headset is that the non-earpiece side gets caught in my hair every time I take it off.  I guess I can figure it out eventually.  I would definitely recommend this headset, and if you have short hair, there would be nothing to complain about.</text>

    <sentence id="8189">
        <text>I have owned this headset for six months now, so this review is based on long-term, near daily use.I previously owned a BlueAnt - it's small and cute but the sound quality was dismal at best. I drive sporty cars so it made it difficult for others to hear me while I was driving. I had disassembled it and found that the pickup tube for the mic was kinked and didn't even face the microphone cutout so I fixed that (and disassembled a second BlueAnt I had purchased - same problem, so it's a design issue, not damage nor a fluke), and it did improve the sound quality on the other end, but not enough. I asked a trucker friend what truckers use for headsets and he recommended the BlueParrot B250-XT. I put off purchase for many months because quite honestly it does look dorky, so I looked at alternatives - Motorolas with the &amp;#34;flip the mic to answer&amp;#34; (the flip-mic-to-answer looks frail, and the reviews confirmed it as a failure point), Jawbones, which are supposedly renown but have had reliability problems, so I decided to put off the purchase.Then I decided to move on from my company and sound quality became much more important as I often take calls from hiring managers while driving and the BlueAnt wasn't cutting it. So, I decided to go ahead with the BlueParrot. When I received it and started using it, I was immediately impressed. For a worst-case test while driving on the highway I called my parents who are hard of hearing. They could clearly understand me while I was in my car with the moonroof open. Perfect! So far the other end has not had sound quality issues, and noise cancellation is obviously working, so the biggest problem (lousy mic + lots of background noise compounding the problem) was solved.On the receiving (my) end sound quality is equally good, as is volume (you can turn the volume up enough to overcome wind noise of open windows on the highway!).Design: it is comfortable to wear (albeit dorky looking), and stays in place, with no having to fiddle with aligning an easy-to-lose silicone cone with your ear canal.Pros:* Fantastic sound quality - on the transmission end, the mic has both great selection and noise cancellation, and the receiving end (the ear speaker) has great fidelity and volume.* Long battery life - and the battery pack is user-replaceable* It is far more comfortable than over-the-ear or in-ear headsets* You can switch sides by merely flipping the microphone boon around 180. I always use it on the right ear because the right ear is nearly always better for language recognition (applying science here) which reduces distraction when talking while doing other things (e.g., driving). Using the left ear requires more concentration (again, based on science not conjecture/opinion) which may result in distracted driving (opinion based on extrapolating the science to its obvious conclusion). Southpaws (lefties) might find the opposite to be true.* You can disable the flashing light, and you can also pair this headset with multiple devices. I don't use either feature but they are good to have.* It comes with an alternate open-cell foam replacement air pad and a replacement foam windscreen for the mic* Replacement battery packs, microphone wind noise screens, and ear cups/pads are readily available on amazon ( I ordered a set when I ordered the headset), and according to my trucker friend who recommended this model, at truck stops (I have not verified the latter).Cons:* As I implied it is utilitarian: form follows function and certainly isn't a fashion statement. More than once at drive throughs I have gotten funny looks and when I asked &amp;#34;do I have something on my face? You're looking at me funny&amp;#34; clerks have told me &amp;#34;Oh, I thought that was one of our headsets.&amp;#34; So it is indeed &amp;#34;dorky&amp;#34; looking.  I've bought more &amp;#34;stylish&amp;#34; bluetooth ear pieces but the sound quality suffered so much that I decided that I don't care. I want a headset that WORKS.* It charges via a barrel connector at 9 VDC rather than 5VDC over Micro-USB or Mini-USB. This means if you go on a trip and forget your charger, you will be unable to charge it on the go, and will be unlikely to find an AC or DC adapter to fit. The design really should have used Mini- or Micro-USB which is pretty standard for phones (except the iPhone). A USB-standard port would also allow for firmware updates to correct bugs (see below)* It requires two hands to put on - a potential hazard while driving. If I am expecting to receive or make calls I try to put it on when stopped, and just flip the mic up until it's needed.* The clip always gets tangled in my hair if I have my hair up or pulled back.  I wish the clip on the end of the head strap were round to prevent this. :-(* Sometimes it will drop the bluetooth connection, and rebooting it and rebooting the phone does not resolve the problem. Keeping it powered off for a period of time (5+ minutes) or plugging it into the charger for even 10 seconds then powering it back up corrects the problem. Other bluetooth headsets I had never had this problem - including the cheap-but-stylish BlueAnts.* I wish the buttons were better placed - I find myself disconnecting calls when reaching for the Volume-UP button.Despite the drawbacks above, I would purchase again but I would probably go for the B250-XT+ to improve upon the already-excellent noise cancellation and sound quality, but aside from the occasional bluetooth connectivity problem I have absolutely no regret going with the B250-XT.Deducting one star due to the occasional connectivity glitch. It doesn't happen often but it usually happens when I need it most.</text>

The people on the other end say that I sound like I'm on a land line phone, even when I'm outside in the wind or driving with the windows down. If I had to complain about anything it would be the comfort, but honestly, after wearing anything on your head for 12 to 14 hours straight, everything is uncomfortable by then. Other than that, it has an amazing battery life. I charge it when I get off at the end of my work week, unplug it when it's fully charged, &amp; it doesn't even come close to being drained by the end of the next work week (I work 5 days a week for 12 to 14 hours a day &amp; talk on this headset for about 8 hours of my work day, talking to customers, dispatch, &amp; so on).</text>

        <text>I use my headset for business calls. I like the headset and it has few advantages over other headsets. It comes with a cigarette charger and a wall charger, so one's at the house and one's in the car. That's works very well for me. I've had very few complaints from others about hearing me. The one complaint i consistently get is is my voice "breaks up". I also get that my voice is low but i have a history of that one. It's not uncomfortable for extended wear.</text>

        <text>I've owned so many different types of bluetooth headsets it's not funny. I've used Blueant, Motorola's, Sony's, you name it. I don't care what kind of special technology is in there, there is never any substitute for putting the microphone next to your mouth. Now combine the boom microphone with a really good noise cancellation, and you've got the perfect FUNCTIONING system.I've used it most often on my bicycle (when i'm not wearing a helmet). I can ride in windy conditions and the person on the other end knows i'm on a bike only because i'm breathing hard. They don't hear the wind. Loud buses or traffic doesn't make a difference. I used it at the ROLLING THUNDER Harley rally here in DC. I swear I couldn't hear my own voice when i was talking, but the person on the other end hears me fine.The buttons are very simple, and on/off/answer button, and an up and down volume buttons (total three buttons).THE WORST PART is you look goofy.

        <text>I have a daily fairly long conference call and have been looking for the perfect headset.  This is it.There are several really good things about this headset.First is the long  "talk" time.  Most have just a few hours which works, unless you have long calls or listen to music or audiobooks or other things where you can go over the few hours.  This will work all day.  Everything else I want to keep going needs to be on the charger.  This has both a car and AC charger, but I can recharge overnight instead of right after a long call.Bluetooth range is great.  Most of the smaller headsets start dropping out if I'm across the room with it facing away from the paired device.  I tried it with Skype on my Mac and it works well there (as well as providing mono audio for other apps).The ear-speaker can be made loud enough to hear.  If you have someone at the other end that sounds like a whisper, you can turn it up where you can hear them.  This is the loudest headset I have found (insert hearing damage disclaimer).The noise cancellation is nearly perfect.  I have a Jawbone that works most of the time, but that little nub will come loose from my face enough to confuse it and the person at the other end starts asking me to repeat even in a silent room and there is no combination of ear inserts that are comfortable and secure that also consistently maintains contact with my face.  Here the mic is easily positioned at the corner of my mouth and if I blast my stereo you might hear a few quiet background whistles when I can barely hear myself! (none do percussion or transients well but my voice was crystal clear).It pairs with 3 devices - I wish it did more (I have too many gadgets), but this is more than most.  It can only work with one of the three at a time, so if I'm skype-ing, I can't use my phone.I find it reasonably comfortable, though it is larger/heavier - but the weight is distributed and it isn't tight.  It also seems to be solidly built.It might look unfashionable in comparison to some fancy in-ear headset, but you will be heard clearly even at a rock-concert, will be able to hear the caller, and be able to use it all day.One update/correction - it pairs with 8, yes EIGHT devices. my two phones, media computer, desktop, laptop, netbook and iPod touch (voice control) are all paired. The instructions say 3 in one place, 7 in another. If you pair a 9th, the oldest one is forgotten so you don't have to delete every one, but might have to redo the pairing on the original device. The only difficulty is that it will try to pair with whatever it can connect with so I often have to shut off one or more devices if they are all in the same room - a "disconnect and try the next" feature would help, but when I'm mobile I usually don't have this problem.. It works great with skype and google talk voice including making phone calls.</text>

I think this might be a common problem and I don't have a lot of confidence it will continue to become easily unstuck several years from now.  This is - by far - the largest negative.2) the usb connection is a micro, not mini, usb.  nothing you probably own will fit it, so you will need to buy all new accessories.3) the micro-sd card that comes with it is WAY too small.

        <text>The killer app for the Blackberry is, and has been the OS. It is the most stable, reliable, and advanced operating system of an smartphone around. I've used the G1, Treo's, Sidekicks, Windows devices and others, this trumps them all.The 8900 is not my first BlackBerry. It will not be my last either since I'm sure they will have something new and lovely I want in a year or two, for now though I'm more than satisfied.Things I Rave about:1) Memory! I have 12 third party applcations installed and still have more memory free than the older Blackberry's come with.2) Audio Video. The screen and speaker are better than any other mobile device around.3) Emaill. It's a BlackBerry, it doing this right all the time is a no brainer.Things I merely love.1) The browser. While it is improved over older devices, it is not quite on par with the G1.2) Camera. It has a great lens, great software to process the pic and is sharp and adjustable. Sadly when trying to zoom in and out the movement is slower than scrolling in other applications.The one thing I dislike is the switch from the mini-usb to the micro-usb.

The screen and camera are much better than the 8320.  I would recommend this BlackBerry to everyone.The only thing I find annoying is the charger.

I hooked it up to my Ipod docking station and it sounds great.6) Battery life is good as with prior Blackberries.

        <text>My first review for this phone was 4 stars.  After using it for a few weeks now I feel I have to reevaluate and drop a star after encountering a growing problem with the trackball.I used the 8700g Blackberry for several years.  It was probably the last BB model that came with a trackwheel on the side instead of the trackball on the front.  Over the years the wheel never malfunctioned.  It was rock solid.  Of course, it was also very ineffective at moving around the screen.  RIM obviously had to come up with a better way.Like all mechanical mouses, the BB trackball will get dirt and dust underneath on the mechanical parts which causes problems with moving the cursor.  My google search indicated that this problem has popped up on probably every single BB made.After using the phone for a few weeks I have noticed that the downward motion is now much slower.  Left, right and up are OK for now, but those are also directions I use the least.  The downward motion is what a user would use to scroll quickly through an email or read a web site.  At this rate I'm going to assume that within 90 days I'm probably going to have to have the phone fixed or find out how to remove the outer casing to clean the trackball myself.  There are online instructions for other BB models, but I've yet to find anything about the 8900.  I'm going to be really annoyed if it's not possible on the user side to fix this problem.Now, on to the other pros and cons . . .ProsNew OS/interface is more stable and offers more featuresPhone is probably the smallest BB with a full keyboard.  A welcome change after using the 8700g, a model about twice the size in total volumeCamera has been upped to 3.2mp and comes with a flash.  Also has a video function, although I haven't tested that yet.Accepts Micro SD cards allowing you to have a full fledged MP3 player.  I put a class six 8gb card in mine for about $30ConsAs stated, the trackball!Back cover is a bit flimsyRIM doesn't provide enough themes with the OS and finding others (the much needed "Today" theme for example) is far more difficult than in the past.  You can get extra themes, but currently (as of early 2009), you will have to look hard for them as RIM isn't currently listing them on their online source page.Phone is actually slower at loading at some web sites than the 8700g on some networks.  The phone has a 2x faster processor.  T-Mobile needs to start thinking about moving on to 3G soon.RIM changed the power cord to micro USB.  The size difference is tiny, but it now forces users to buy new accessories (e.g. car chargers).  No excuse for this.The 8900 is a great phone to use.  It's an improvement over the earlier Curve and it's a few light years ahead of the old 8700g.  But the possible deal breaker for me is that trackball.  That the problem popped up so quickly and is such a common problem along the entire BB product line angers me more.  RIM should have come up with a solution for this by now.</text>
    </sentence>
    <sentence id="8215">
        <text>Updated OS, 3.2 mp camera, restyled case.Those the three main upgrades in store for anyone who previously owned a Curve. While the 8900 is a nice upgrade for sure - RIM still suffers from build issues in the Curve model line. The battery door on mine (and I've read elsewhere that others have this too) is loose and has "give" to it when I type (yes, you can solve this by sticking a business card between the battery and door).I've been using the 8900 for a couple weeks now. I also have a BlackBerry Bold (which I prefer for the larger screen and different keypad which I find easier to use).If you have small hands - the 8900 is a nice phone. It's size will fit in your palm just right and not be difficult to hold.In practice I find the control keys (send, end, escape, menu) that are between the screen and the keyboard are difficult (perhaps uncomfortable is a better word) to press. If you don't press in the right spot - there's very little give and after a while continued use hurts your finger.The smaller keyboard on the 8900 is less comfortable for me. I'm using a BlackBerry Bold whose keyboard I prefer because the keys are less pointed on the Bold. This will be a matter of preference - so you should try the 8900 keyboard yourself prior to making a final decision.In testing the OS on the 8900 is fairly stable. I've owned T-Mobile UMA equipped BlackBerry's before and they all seem to have some tendency to sporadically lock up on incoming calls when on UMA (which is voice and data sent over Wi-Fi). The lock ups don't happen frequently (maybe once a week at most) - but they're annoying.RIM's latest OS (4.6) has a major lag time when re-booting. I haven't run a stopwatch against my devices but both the Bold and the 8900 easily run 5 minutes to reboot. Hopefully enough people will complain and RIM will fix this. Earlier models of the BlackBerry had this same reboot lag but I do not remember it being this lengthy.Overall here's my BlackBerry 8900 PRO / CON list:PROS:- Uses a much improved BlackBerry OS 4.6.x- Vastly improved camera of 3.2 mp- T-Mobile UMA allows calls via Wi-Fi when out of native T-Mobile coverage- T-Mobile UMA allows data, sms, mms via Wi-Fi- Re-designed form factor for those needing a smaller phoneCONS:- Battery cover has give when pressed during normal use- Lacks 3G capabilities- T-Mobile cellular coverage in Northeast (and I believe elsewhere) is the worst of all carriers- Sporadic lock ups while on UMA- Smaller screen and keyboard may be too small for some (especially screen)- Inserting micro-SD card requires removing battery cover (though not battery)Is this a good phone to buy?In a word - Yes. I think for the price Amazon offers it (after rebate) you have a hard time finding a better bargain. Given all the pros and cons I think you should zero in on the T-Mobile coverage first and be sure that you'll be adequately covered in your home usage area.Also, first time BlackBerry buyers should be aware that there's a mandatory BlackBerry data plan required to use this phone. I've read lots (LOTS) of messages on discussion boards about people trying to get around this and while it seems that some do skirt the data requirement (and be aware that if you buy through Amazon you are required to keep data on your line for a period of time or you can be assessed a penalty) - most find that there's no good way around a BB plan.</text>

        <text>Product itself isn't perfect, but can't blame the seller.

        <text>Just had to chime in here with my frustration with this adapter and my unlocked E71 (gave the product a 5 star rating because it is not its fault it didn't work with my phone).  It's bad enough that the E71 has a 2.5mm headphone jack vs. the standard 3.5mm jack found on 99% of the electronic devices in the US, but for some reason, the E71x sold in US by AT&amp;T; has a different configuration on the earphone port than the unlocked version of the E71 I bought on Amazon.If you have the non-AT&amp;T; version of this phone, you will need a different adapter --&gt; the AD-50 (has 2 plastic rings) instead of this AD-61 (has 3 plastic rings). I had the same experience as others here getting only one channel to work on the headphones when using this device (and I bought another item at Radio Shack with same results).  Of course, you will lose the functionality of the built in microphone that came with the hands-free wired setup, but at least, you will be able to choose from hundreds of earphones and enjoy much better sound than with those junk earphones that came with the phone!  The other downside is this huge adapter (AD-50) sticking out of the side of your phone.  Why Nokia, Why!!!</text>

        <text>First let me say this works fine when connecting standard headphones to my HTC made "Verizon Wireless SMT5800" (model number LIBR100), clear audio quality, I would say better then bluetooth stereo quality wise so no degradation of the signal.The first hitch is the size, my phone's a couple inches long and this adapter effectively doubles the length. I really underestimated the size when looking at a picture but it's manageable.Then it has a quirk where if you disconnect the headphones while the adapter is connected to the phone you have to unplug the adapter again or it wont read the headphones when you plug them back it, upon plugging them back in it triggers the voice command prompt for some reason, I am not sure if this is a problem with the adapter or with the windows mobile on my phone.Other then the above two notes this product works fine, ordered it so I could use my phone as a mp3 player on a upcoming flight since my bluetooth headphones would not be a option and I see no reason it will not work.</text>

It is pretty much like an ipod cradle. I find the audio out from my Tilt to be superior to my itouch with my tilt connected to this adapter and the itouch to the apple cradle. Unexpected but true! The sound from the tilt + this adapter seems more dynamic to me.Also, the price is excellent.</text>

        <text>Cannot get audio out from the 3.5 connection. I tried several standard headphones. More so, when plugged in, the phone starts auto-dialing last dialed numbered.I spent quite a lot of time trying to understand how I can make it work. Searching and reading over the Web taught me that it is no slam dunk. 2.5 and 3.5 connectors can be wired in a number of different ways and support mono, stereo, mic, etc. There are plugs with 1, 2 and 3 rings (respectively with 2, 3 and 4 connectors - the connector is the metal part between the rings).However this is HTC part meant to work with my HTC Mogul Sprint phone - and it doesn't. My conclusion so far is that this adapter came with some short of a defect or a 'short' in its wiring though my empirical tests are not conclusive. For example, I can get mono audio out by plugging in a telephone headset into the 2.5 connection. The weird thing is that if I plug my stereo standard 3.5 headphone into that same connection (using another 2.5 to 3.5 adapter) I do not get audio.After many frustrating hours I came up with one workaround that works - plug an earphone into the proprietary port and check for sound, then plug another one in the 2.5 and test and then plug -slowly- the 3.5 in - this gets me audio out and then I can unplug the other two.I just returned mine and ordered another from the same vendor. I hope the part was defective; I shudder to think that is how it is supposed to work or that there is a problem with the phone itself.</text>

Without cutting your nails or taking off gloves, you can use this stylus to select icons, answer calls, write email and text messages, play games, "draw" on the screen, or surf the web.Personally, I don't have long nails, but I do have trouble hitting the right letters on my iPhone. The Pogo Stylus makes it much easier to get it right the first time. In addition, you don't have to worry about scratches or finger smudges, either.I love mine and it works perfectly. You don't have to SMASH it on the screen to get it to work. (As a matter of fact, pressing too hard will mess up your tip.)  Just tap lightly with the full face of the tip and you'll have no trouble at all.My only wish is that there were a way to attach it to my Mophie Juice Pack AirMophie Juice Pack Air (Red) for iPhone 3G &amp; 3Gs. The clip that comes with the stylus fits over the iPhone alone. There are clips available that fit over a variety of other iPhone cases, but not the Mophie. For now, I have to carry it in my wallet. But it's worth it.</text>

        <text>I have tried both the rubber "bubble" tip types and these foam-tip Pogos. For drawing, the Pogo Sketch beats all. The key to any of these things, is not press down as hard as you would with a pen or pencil. Doing so will likely burst your bubble (no pun intended) and/or wear away the tip. None of these pointing devices last a lifetime, but I've used my Pogo stick for well over a year, none the worse for wear.</text>

        <text>Purchase the Ten One Design Pogo Sketch Stylus for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch because I didn't like the smudges I left on my phone &amp; iPad screens when I would you my fingers to navigate the games, programs, etc. It works as described, but I wished it was more pointed to be able to draw fine lines when using the drawing apps.  Also, after a while the tip of the stylus would wear out which is not good.</text>

        <text>I was fairly excited to hear about this product. While I do find the iPhone screen simple to use, I thought I could get some extra finesse with this thing.Well, finess is one thing it does not have. It is very light - and there is a sort of conductive foam tip. This foam tip seems quite flimsy and I have no confidence it will remain attached for very long. The whole thing is put together with perhaps 20 cents worth of stuff - and they have the gall to charge $15 or more for it.So - to the function:It take a great deal more effort to effect the screen than your finger alone. The screen really does not read it well - and you have to push far harder than I am comfortable doing.The screen does recognize it - eventually - but really - it's flimsy tip is the problem in my mind.Overall - not worth the effort or the $$ - fingers are free and work far better on the iPhone or iPod touch. Get a nice screen protector and you will be far happier.</text>

        <text>I bought this to use it with my iPad as I have purchased several apps including one hand writing recognition app. I thought it would be nice to have a stylus to use. Well, the stylus really does not work well for writing. I found that my finger is just as reliable. The Pogo Sketch has a thick tip on it and it really feels like you are writing with a crayon on a piece of paper. You really can't write small or neatly. Because I get the same result using my finger as I do the pogo sketch, I figure I might as well save myself the trouble and not have to worry about losing the pogo sketch.So for writing this really doesn't work that well. For tapping icons it is good, for drawing it's pretty good and I've seen some incredible pieces of art come out of using it.I was hoping it would be like the old palm stylus, fine point and really easy to do text entry. This is far from it. Imagine using a crayon to write to get an idea of how big the point is.</text>

        <text>For those of you that are challenged because of large digits or imperfect keyboard positioning this "stylish" stylus is a must have.  I have long been envious of 1st generation texter's whose fingers fly over the keyboards of their wireless devices.  Up to this point in time, I have been unable to match their keyboard speed or even come close until I discovered the "Sketch" by Pogo.  Now while I can't beat them, I can at least put up some decent numbers speed wise.Even though the 3GS is almost smudge proof this tool will keep those screens finger print free and glistening which is the way it was intended to look.A good buy and excellent value.</text>

        <text>I found the item to work well for general use on (a) a Samsung Galaxy Tab and (b) a Samsung Focus smart phone.This item seems to be working better over time (it may be some adjustment on my own part to the feel of it).  It has a good length and feels much like a slim pen (others I've tried were too short).  The tip is a foam (rather than a rubber ball), and I will be interested to see how it wears over time - but I am pleased with it so far.Much of the criticism I've seen of these types of products are by people disappointed that the tips are too thick and flexible to work for drawing/notetaking purposes - I don't think the product is really well suited for that (I have 3 differnt stylus items, and none are suited to drawing) so if that is the desired use, something else should be sought.The comments about the clip being rather flimsy are well grounded.  I admit to stressing it, but it snapped somewhat easier than I think it should have.</text>

        <text>I purchased this stylus after my second Box Wave Capacitive iPad Stylus (Crimson Red) broke.  This stylus has been an excellent replacement to the Bow Wave and I honestly wish that I would have purchased this stylus first versus wasting my time on the Box Wave stylus.  I have not had to replace this stylus at all! It is very durable, reliable and responsive.  I used it on my iPad and I'm currently waiting for my iPad 2 to come in the mail so that I can use it with that one as well. It's lightweight and feels good in the hand.  I like the fact that it's not bulky. The only frustration that I've experienced is my displeasure at misplacing it and having to search for it and not being able to locate it right away!  I hate when I can't find this stylus due to my own negligence!  I absolutely love this stylus and plan on purchasing more so that I can have more than one on hand. I highly recommend getting it.</text>

        <text>If you're looking for improved handwriting, this may help you...a little. I bought this for my iPad thinking that it would help with a handwriting note app that I purchased. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the pen.  It's a metal rod with a glued on foam tip.  It does help with handwriting (anything is better than a fingertip) but it lacks a fine point that is needed to accurately draw and write.For note taking I will likely continue to use the onscreen keyboard and the Evernote app instead of the pen . The handwriting capability with a pen/stylus just isn't there yet.  I expected better results.  I'll still use the pen for point and click stuff.  I don't think it's worth the $10 I paid for it. Maybe $5, maybe.</text>

        <text>I bought this for my wife to go along with her Creative Zen M300 4GB player. The concept is great.  Small, light weight headphones that are bluetooth.  We had problems right away.  It was a pain to connect earbuds to mp3 player because the lights on the earbuds were not doing what the instructions were saying.  I started playing around with it and after an hour figured out what the lights on the earbuds were indicating.  The earbuds hold the battery that you recharge. You pull back the flap on the back of one of them and you plug in the charger.  Even though my wife has small hands, she struggled with getting the plug into the earbuds.  This caused a lot of frustration and the back of the earbud eventually broke exposing the charge port on the earbud to moisture from my wife's workouts and it eventually stopped charging.  The sound quality was not very good.  As for battery life, expect 2-3 hours with normal volume. I have low expectations of bluetooth in general, and these were worse than what I could tolerate.

        <text>I bought this thing to replace a Samsung that sounded great but was a little clunky. I was immediately dissapointed by the charger that was clearly designed for some other item and kind-of-half-way attaches to one earphone. It's not a micro-USB type, but something that must be plugged into the wall--NOT your 2 USB car charger, next to your phone. The actual headset was remarkably sleek, so I kept an open mind during the eight-hour initial charging session. I was again dissapointed at once by the flat, tinny sound that finally came through the stylish and lightweight headset when I finally played the new coldplay album from my Android phone. I am no audiophile but the sound from these earbuds was really, really noticeably poor compared to the Samsung they replaced. If you like heavy deep base you are really in for a let-down. In summary, it looks cool, it's functional, I'll wear it to the gym, but it sounds substandard.UPDATE:Downgraded to one star. After listening to these earphones for an hour, I decided that the sound quality was unacceptably poor. Fortunately, Amazon has a fantastic way of handling returns and I was able to print a return authorization and shipping label--postage included--for a full refund. My first return experience with Amazon will make me less hesitant to purchase items online and more likely to choose Amazon over other sellers.</text>

        <text>First, what's really good about these: They are tiny. Earbuds connected by a short wire and somehow, all the bluetoothey goodness in there without a bulge or box.Second: They sound very good. Rock on!For phone use, they are pretty good. A few complaints from the other end when they have occasional trouble hearing me, but usable.One odd disadvantage is the bulky power supply which connects via the Sony standard connector which is bigger than the earbud it plugs into! It connects just to a few pins on one end. Weird.If you charge these at home, it's no issue but if you want to bring these on a trip with you, you have to pack this power supply. No USB charger, either -- it's wall current only. But the charge lasts a very long time so as long as you are not traveling, you don't need the charger.Sure wish they had use a micro USB charger connection.And yes, it does work with an iPhone 4.

        <text>These earbuds sound about as good as I suspect bluetooth can, and are the only wireless earbuds I've found anywhere that I can honestly describe as comfortable and well-designed. This setup quite simply makes all other design efforts look bad. I don't mind the lack of controls-- I've always done everything through the phone anyway-- and my only real caveats are the annoying paper tag you're not supposed to remove and the short battery life. I recognize that the latter is probably unavoidable, but anything that could be done to improve battery life would be _most_ welcome. Also, it would be _very_ helpful if this device was USB-chargeable. I carry a large battery with a USB port on it to recharge my stuff, and have no access to an AC plug for most of the day. Active noise cancellation would be nice too, but is perhaps too much to wish for.I like using these earbuds so much with my iPhone 3gs that I plan to buy a second pair to give me enough battery life to last through a work shift, so that in essence I'll be paying over $200 for something that a single pair of, say, Motorolas might theoretically do for about a quarter of that price. But these are _comfortable_ and _loud_ where nothing else is, and therefore well worth the extra expense and trouble of having to keep two pair on hand.</text>

        <text>These are probably one of the best bluetooth stereo headphones I've owned.  Sony is generally great when it comes to audio, and this headset is no different.  The design is amazing.  Very minimalist and sure to get you compliments and questions.  The power light is pretty discreet, which is also good since I hate loud blinking lights on my ears.  The cord is rather short, and if you have long hair and wear it down, it can get caught under the weight of your hair and tug.  The supplied earbuds ensure it stays put nice and snug and won't come out, even when jogging on open road.  The sound quality is also pretty good.  The bass isn't as strong as I'd like, but it does produce a nice overall and clear sound.  Coupled with the nose canceling earbuds and it makes for a good listening experience.  Call quality is also pretty good.  Volume is loud and clear and people I'm calling can't tell I'm using bluetooth.  Since there's only one button, it took me a bit to get used to the different functions it can be used for, and I'm sure there's still more I need to learn.  A long press powers it off and on, and the accompanying chime that goes with it are slightly different (lo-hi for ON and hi-lo for OFF).  Also, a shorter press of the button will activate the voice command feature (at least on a Motorola Droid Bionic) and it took me a while to get used to the different lengths I needed to hold the button in order to get the response I wanted.  The biggest drawback to this headset is the charger.  I'll admit that when I first received it and took all the components out of the box and saw the supplied charger, I had NO idea how I was supposed to get the headset on it.  I looked over the directions several times, and it shows in the diagram three different types of chargers you can use.  I'm assuming I didn't get what I was actually supposed to get in the box because the supposed included carrying case was not in there; instead, I got a little drawstring pouch.  Two of the three pictured chargers looked like something I could figure out, but the one that was included in my box was pretty hard to understand.  The charging contacts was at least twice the size of the earbud!!  How was I supposed to get that on??  I tried jamming it on one of the little plastic tabs on the charger, but I didn't want to push too hard because the charger looks very cheaply built and, quite honestly, antiquated.  It looks like a charger you'd see for a cell phone from the 90's.  The directions also don't really tell you how you're supposed to put them together.  I sat on my couch looking at it for a good 15 minutes before I just jammed them both together, after I stopped caring whether or not I broke it.  Surprisingly, that worked.  You have to push the earbud onto one of the tabs on the charger at a 90 degree angle pretty hard, but apparently, that's how it charges.  It'll suck when I need to travel with it / lose or break the charger / or just need another one, since it's such a weird little proprietary thing that looks like it stopped being manufactured at least 10 years ago.  If not for that god awful charger, this would be one of the best stereo bluetooth headsets available.  I still very much like it, but I can't give it a higher review because I foresee that charger becoming an issue down the road.</text>

        <text>I purchased these bluetooth headphones because of their size. I've had problems syncing them to my iPhone from time to time, and also the battery life on them isn't very good. They also don't hold a charge for very long. If you charge these up, and leave them, they will discharge on their own within a week or two. I'd say 3 hours is about the most you'll be able to get out of them fully charged. However, if you can live with that, they are the smallest bluetooth headphones out there that I can find, basically a set of earbuds that connect to each other behind the neck. The size of them is great, the sound is good, and I really like using them. I just wish they'd last a full day of use. If you get these, make sure you have a wired set as a backup because these will run out of juice on you and you'll need the wired ones to keep you going. But if you need them just for a workout or a commute to work you will probably be ok with these. I would still purchase them, even though the price is high for bluetooth headphones/earbuds, because they're so small and the sound is good.</text>

    <sentence id="8264">
        <text>While this headset is unique and quite sleek, I can't say too many positive things about this.  Here are the list of reasons why this headset is terrible:1) Fidelity - The sound quality was on par with a set of Coby earbuds, all mids and no highs or lows.  I had the earpiece properly inserted into my ear, sounds horrible.  Don't understand why some reviewers are saying the sounds are great, it truly lacks bandwidth and frequency response.2) Charging - Looks like the &amp;#34;charger&amp;#34; was an after thought or their attempt at recycling old stock.  You get this whacky, what I guess is a cell phone charger, but only a few pins on the charging are used, so only one &amp;#34;latch&amp;#34; out of two of the connector on the charger-side is used.  The charger looks Mickey-Moused.3) Lack of Volume and Next Track/Previous Track - Ok, no volume control I can deal with, no skip track or previous track?  That renders it unusable.  A while ago, I figured out that making playlists were really a waste of time, so I like to randomize my entire mp3 library on my iphone.  No next track/previous track means I have to whip out the phone.  The default corded iphone earbud with remote allows me to skip to next track, adjust volume without having to whip out my phone.  This feature is what garners this product a two-star.4) Wrong Material Choice?  The rubber on the ear bud fittings are of chalky, &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feeling rubber, as such, it will not grip the inside of your ear.  The slightest movement will make the ear bud fittings work itself out of your ear.  I miss my AcoustiBuds by Burton Technology.  They seemed to have gotten this part right, why can't a corporate giant like Sony/Ericsson get a simple material selection?  Did they not test it?  Did they test it on their own moist ear and said &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; and called it a day?  This is a piss poor selection of material, these in-ear buds have been around since they started handing out headsets on airplanes some 30 years ago.  With today's wider selection of all sorts of exotic rubbers, they couldn't get this little detail correct?5) The remote (if you can call it that) seriously is in a wrong place.  It's too high up.  I think this length was design for people with shorter necks.  It just wasn't well thought out.6)  Accessories that came with this earbud - the little clip that came with it is a joke, and removing the clip damaged the insulation on the wires.  The protective bag is just a cheap cloth bag you find in gimmicky audio accessories from generic manfacturers.What ever happened to Sony?  This brand has really gone down the drain.  Their TV sets suck, their audio accessories suck, their video game console sucks, everything from this company as of late really sucks.  This company is a joke.  And partnering/absorbing/merging with another dying company like Ericsson isn't really helping Sony developing good products at all...</text>

These look awesome out of the box - but the sound quality was terrible - now these are songs that I have purchased from itunes if that makes a differnece -- but the sound made these basically unusable -- as I have found with previous BT stereo headsets - oh well -I guess I 'll keep waiting.</text>

        <text>This is the best car charger that I've ever used.

Unfortunately my Palm Pre of 3 years finally did take a dump, but I'm still purchasing a new car charger from them because I gave my old one to my brother (after it no longer charged through the usb port anymore).Pros:-$10-Compact-Charges better, not all 12V adapters are made the same. Neither are all USB cablesCons:-Only fits the palm pre cord (ok not only I suppose, but the only micro usb cord that I own)-Only a single usb port (but that really isn't a huge deal either)Whether you are lucky enough to still have a working Palm Pre or not, if your phone uses micro USB, then its worth getting this.

I have not tried my other charger cables to see if they will work with this charger port. I like this anyway and will get another usb for my Blackberry if I need to. Cute design and can be tossed in a purse, if you ride with others and need to take it with you. The cord fits very snug, I doubt it would just slip out. I like to keep car chargers around, because I travel frequently.</text>

That same cable plugs into a wall adapter, and can also be a USB cable to charge from or connect to my laptop.Some reviews complain about the cable length...I think it's appropriate for a travel charger that you need to throw into your bag and don't want a whole bunch of cable.  For my intended use, the shorter cable is a plus.If you just need a regular car charger to keep in your vehicle, there are probably better options that would come with a longer cable.</text>

        <text>I'll start with the only negative:  The headphones are made of very light weight plastic and it feels like it is going to break when you handle them.  When you wear them, they feel great.  so, maybe its just imagination but so far, they have stayed together :).Overall, I love these headphones and think they are great. Battery lasts entire work day and then some!  I would recommend these to you as long as you are careful with your electronics and are not going to be running around with them on or dropping them to the floor.

        <text>Update: As of 2010-10-14, Motorola S305 headphones are available at a price that is approximately the same as these Sony 'phones. There is now no reason to choose Sony. The Moto 'phones are equal or better in every aspect. In particular, the Moto 'phones stay on your head easily.These headphones offer good performance for the price. As other reviewers have noted, there are significant problems with this gadget. I suggest a work-around for some of these problems.Sound quality: not great. I have a pair of Sennheiser PMX60 mini-headphones that have better bass and a more "detailed" sound. But these little Sennheisers are about the same prices as the Sonys: http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PMX-60-PMX60-Headphones/dp/B00009LI55/ref=sr_1_45?ie=UTF8&amp;s;=electronics&amp;qid;=1264384037&amp;sr;=1-45.Construction: these headphones are built light. They are suitable for doing chores around the house, brisk walks, and so forth. For use during all out exercise with sweat and motion, I'm just not sure.Fit: as other reviewers have noted, these 'phones fit the head very loosely. tilt your head forward, and they will slide right off. There is a related issue too. The drivers inside those big fat foam pads are tiny. You must position the drivers precisely over your ear canals, or the sound will be worse than "not great." It will be terrible.My suggestion: in light of the above issues with fit and positioning, I recommend the use of a jury-rigged "leash" to hold the headphones securely on the head of the user. Such a leash fits the back of ones head. I fashioned my leash out of a cut-up Croakies eyewear retainer. I uploaded two photos to this review to illustrate my work, such as it is. I have used this idea with other headphones and I have had good results in all cases.Compatibility and stability: I have paired these headphones with three devices. The pairing process was effortless. These 'phones work well with my Motorola cell phone, my iPod Touch, and my notebook computer. In fact, I have used these 'phones with my cell phone and iPod at the same time. Listening to music, when a phone call comes in, I can touch one button on the 'phones to answer. Very convenient! With the notebook computer, I can use the controls on the 'phones to do pause/resume, skip forward/skip reverse, and volume up/volume down. With the iPod Touch, I can do all of these except skip forward/skip reverse. By the way, you cannot use the microphone function with the iPod Touch either. Just Apple being Apple, I guess.On the subject of iPod, here is a trouble-shooting tip: while listening to music with my iPod Touch, I encounter frequent dropouts. What happens is that the sound ceases for about one half of a second. It is irritating, and it happens to me several times per hour of use. The solution is to disable WiFi on the iPod Touch. It seems that the iPod bluetooth and WiFi radios have trouble working together. The "dropout" problem is especially bad if the WiFi signal is weak. It seems obvious to me that this is an iPod problem, not a Sony headphone problem.Value: these are the only stereo bluetooth headphones I can find that are fit to purpose AND less than $100. Sony also gives you a telephone quality microphone. In fact, I got these for a lot less than $100, so I consider this to be an excellent value. Frankly, I wish that there were more choices in the marketplace. No matter. The marketplace is what it is, and this product is the best deal that I could find.I suppose that I have presented a rather conflicted view of this product, but I am getting a lot of enjoyment out of it. I like to wear it while doing chores around the house. With conventional wired headphones, I have issues with my arms getting tangled in the headphone leads and pulling the 'phones or music player out of place. These Sony headphones are much more pleasant to use.</text>

        <text>While audiophiles will naturally shun this product and anything less than perfection, this headset is quite decent for the masses.  Of course, an open-ear design will mean less bass response, but they handle the lows better than average.Pairing was easy to my G1, but my PC was more finicky - not the headset's fault at all.Range was surprising, but again half of this equation has nothing to do with the headset, rather the device it's being connected to and the amount of interference in the airwaves.Overall, for the average masses, this headset will more than please.  If you have strict tastes, then you won't be buying this anyway.</text>

        <text>This set of Bluetooth headphones works well. I've been using them for about two weeks now, and I am quite pleased. The product is easy to pair, easy to charge (though it would be nice to have an adapter that you can plug in, out of the box it only has a USB cable for charging on a computer), and easy to use. This product has volume controls, play controls, talk controls, and a built-in mic that all work well.Is this product comparable to a $200 pair of Bluetooth headphones? Of course not, but if you want to spend less than $50 on a pair of headphones that gives you reasonable quality, convenience, and has a battery life which is quite acceptable, give these headphones a try.

        <text>I had read plenty of reviews of wireless headsets.  I really wanted a headset that I could wear in the gym and be active in while still listening to my music.  I've had terrible luck with arm bands in the gym.  So I thought I'd give this a try.  I've already gone through a Motorola headset that died after two weeks.  The reviews on the Sony are positive so I thought I'd try it.This headset works quite well. The base unit is smaller than about the size of a man's thumb in my estimation.  The unit comes with a few different ear buds to switch out.  The cords do get tangled easily though.  Then again, most headsets have that problem.  The unit paired in seconds, charged well and keeps a decent charge.  On some of my songs, the sound is somewhat tinny but still good.Usage is a bit odd.  The cords are not long enough so that you could clip it to the end of a sleeve.  And if you wear it in the gym, you'll have to clip it to your collar of your shirt.  And this is a bit odd.  Basically you'll have a thumb sized bulge on or under your shirt at neck level.  I've gotten a few stares because it looks weird.  Then again, while running on the treadmill, it's super convenient.The iPhone is the bummer since it doesn't support the full volume control and track skipping.  But this unit works just fine beyond that.  I'm very happy with it.Update:  I must have doomed the stupid thing.  Minutes after I wrote this review, the unit won't power on any more.  I have no idea what happened but it's dead.  Thankfully it's under 30 days so I'm returning it.  Downgrading my rating to two stars.  The price is fine, just a shame that it might not be that sturdy.</text>

These ear buds are fitted with soft rubber pads that rest in the ear without entering the ear canal. For walking they are very comfortable and stable - no fiddling with them as with various wired ear buds tried. The clip-on Bluetooth transceiver clips on most anything and remains in place while walking. Software is very responsive and automatically connects when music is playing and the transceiver is turned on.

        <text>It's been a while since I looked at the reviews but someone commented on the device having a wire kind of takes away from it being blutooth and they are 100% correct.Pros1. The device has really good sound quality.2. The device if very comfortable to wear.  My other blutooth stereo headset is a Motorola S9 and isn't that comfortable and frankly starts to hurt quickly.Cons1. I hate the wire.  PERIOD...a. It's not really long enough to clip onto belt or pocket and I'm an average size man of 5'10".  Isn't long enough to clip to end of long sleeve or even go in jacket pocket.b. The clip doesn't isn't that great to clip to shirt (if you clip to chest like t-shirt with no pocket).  Doesn't clip well to collar because the end control piece is too heavy or bulky around one's neck.c. The actually controls are upside down.  Look at the device picture..  If you were to put the earbuds in and hold the device in front of you the cable points up.  It should go down.  If it could clip to belt which it doesn't reach it would be upright but IF you had to read it then it's upside down to your view.  Like the person looking at me needs to be able to read it.  (not)d. frankly..  Any amount of cable means that the thing might as well just plug into my phone.  I'm not sure how I'd make it better but I guess I'd rather have a self contained headset that is only on my head.  But like I said before the Motorola S9 isn't that comfortable and doesn't sound near as good as this Sony.</text>

        <text>I've had these headphones for nearly a year now, and I still love them.I never had any real use for bluetooth headset -- I have an iPhone, but I don't use phone service on it, and I don't use Skype. (Yes, it's true -- I just don't like talking to people.)  But, I *do* like listening to music, and my macbook pro had a design flaw: the amplifier for the headphone port lacked shielding it needed, so any headphones plugged in played all kinds of whiny, buzzy, clicky sounds.  Finally, my husband suggested I try a bluetooth headset.  Going straight to digital should cut out the noise, right?Yep. Totally worked.  But also... wow.  The sound on these earbuds is fabulous, and they're soooooo comfortable and convenient, especially with the computer.  With the iPhone, and the iPad, the skip function doesn't work. (This is Apple's fault, not Sony's), but everything functions beautifully with the computer.  How nice to be able to wander all around the house and still (privately) listen to my music!There is a little trouble getting devices reconnected, though I suspect this is a flaw with the protocol itself, or Apple's implementation of it.  Often it takes me a few tries to get the headphones paired with whichever device I'm using.  I do have three different devices paired with the same set of headphones, though, and I have no additional trouble with switching between them.My only (slight) complaint is that plugging the headphones into USB to charge turns them off.As for durability... I clip the module onto my pocket, collar, or a sturdy necklace.  I have used this constantly for nearly a year now, and while I try not to beat it up, I haven't been especially gentle.  It gets shoved in my purse and dropped on the desk and generally whacked around.  It's as good as new.  Keep in mind that it's got a small clip -- meant for a shirt, not a belt.</text>

        <text>I went through two of these thinking I had a bad headset.  It wasn't the headset.I paired this headset to my iPhone &amp; Macbook.  It is an in-ear design meaning the earbud goes in the ear canal and creates a seal to isolate outside sound.  I like this design but its not ideal for all situations (ie. jogging or whenever you need to pay some attention to things like oncoming traffic).The clip is weak.  If you attach this to your shirt and go jogging, it can ride up and fall down.The forward/reverse, next song buttons do not work with the iPhone but did work with the Palm Pre.  Volume buttons does work but does not control the iPhone's bluetooth volume.Sound quality on the iPhone and Mac is bad.  It sounds like it cannot handle the treble and makes it sound scratchy.  I got this on two different headsets.  It could be Apple's bluetooth drivers causing this.  I even changed the audio settings on the iPhone with no luck.  I paired this to my brothers Palm Pre and it sounded great (for bluetooth headset).Overall, I'm not terribly dissappointed but I wish I waited for a better price...</text>

        <text>Overall, these are a decent and affordable Bluetooth headset with stereo sound and the ability to pair to multiple devices.  Standby time is exemplary, although I only get a few hours (2-3) of actual use from them.  Sound quality is just OK, especially for someone like me who is used to around-the-ear headphones with big drivers.  These are a step up from the stock earbuds that came with my old Walkman phone from years ago, but not by much.  Maybe I am just expecting too much from such tiny in ear buds?My only real complaint with these besides sound quality is that all audio tends to sound a little scratchy.  This unit is paired to multiple devices (A Samsung smartphone, an HTC smartphone, my PC and my Walkman phone) and audio from all sounds very 8-bit.  Finely tuned audiophiles may wish to look elsewhere.  Oh, and they are tricky to charge.  They only seem to fully charge from my PC's powered USB port.  A dedicated wall jack charger with high capacity (&gt;900 mAh) seems to cause it to go into error mode.  It's a minor inconvenience, and even on the PC USB jack it charges in about two hours.Update: One earbud has completely quit working as of March 2014, so it is no longer suitable for music use.  Despite the age, the battery is holding up well and seems to last forever when charged but turned off.</text>

        <text>ThisBlackberry Standard Lithium-ion Replacement Battery C-S2is listed as being for the Blackberry 8330, 8310, 8320, and 8300 Curve Smartphone, but with that C-S2 designation, it's also the replacement for the BlackBerry Curve 9330. Bought this because my original C-S2 battery and a backup of the same were failing.The original that came with the phone is listed at 1150mAh, and is supposed to have a talk time of three hours, with a standby time of 1 days. When my talk time had hit under an hour and standby time was less than a day, it was time to replace it. Since the BlackBerry C-S2 battery has a cryptographic chip to ensure you're using the right one for the particular BlackBerry smartphone you have, it should either work or be a dud.And when I received this battery, it was a dud.But going back to the original documentation for these, the BlackBerry C-S2 battery requires a full 8-hour or longer charge before it can be used, so I charged this one. That did the trick... to some degree.This replacement has never been quite up to the talk time of the original when it was new, but at about 2 hours, it wasn't worth sending back, so I've kept it. This one is better than another that I picked up here from another vendor, so it was better to hold onto one that worked as opposed to one that didn't.Your experiences may be different, and from some of the reviews posted here, that seems to be the case. If I planned on keeping my 9330 Curve for a few more years, I might have complained, but there are other smartphones that get better life (and performance) today, so this one is at least a solution that keeps it going for now.If you get one of theseBlackberry Standard Lithium-ion Replacement Battery C-S2packs here, my only suggestion is that you charge it for 8-12 hours before you use it.

        <text>I tested this charger plug on my LG env3 (vx9200) cellphone. I also used this with a different (mini) usb cord to recharge a Sansa Clip mp3 player.

It's not an OEM product but the plug is sturdy and functions well.Very pleased with the price and performance - purchased from IBD Electronics.

    <sentence id="8343">
        <text>I purchased this product through Amazon (from Seller1ON1) to power a variety of devices, including an HTC cell phone, all which require power from a micro-USB cable.Exclusive of the cables, the five chargers I purchased all worked well and were within their stated specification. They are rated at 5.1V and 0.7A.  For each, I measured their output at 5.1V open circuit, 5.0 to 5.05V at 700 to 830 mA, and dropping to 4.1-4.4 V at about 850mA.  While many low cost chargers sold here are counterfeit items, these chargers (at least the ones I got) are not, they are the real thing.However, some of the cables provided were not reliable.  The cable that's supplied with the charger (LG cable part number SGDY0014303) connects to the charger using a standard USB Type A connector at one end, and at the other end connects to the phone using a micro-USB connector, which is fast becoming the standard for cell phone power.I purchased five sets of chargers and cables, and found that three of the five cables were bad.  Let me describe the bad ones:I haven't used the cables with an LG phone, but using them with several other devices and phones I found that the micro-USB connector was often intermittent.  There is a fair amount of play when the connector is plugged in, and if it wiggles just a little bit the power connection is lost.I microscopically compared that male micro-USB connector with others that I have on better cables. See the photo I posted of both good and bad connectors.The better cables have connectors that are far superior.  The connector on the three bad SGDY0014303 cables have metal contacts that have very little compliance so that only when the connector is plugged into the receptical perfectly does it make a good connection.  If the array of metal contacts are not perfectly coplanar with the corresponding contacts in the receptical, contact is easily lost.  Further, the hole in the connector was a bit too large, making the connector fit loosely.  When I examine the micro-USB male connectors of the other cables I have, I see that their contacts are made of a much larger bent metal spring that is more forgiving of misalignment -- it continues to make contact no matter how much the connector is wiggled in the receptical, and the connection is much tighter overall.I find that when I charge my HTC phone using the bad cables, I have to be very careful to make sure the connector is actually making contact, and adjust it if it is not, so the phone charges.The other two cables are constructed a little differently, and work fine.  All five cables are marked identically, with LG logos that look the same.  Further, the wire gauge and the plastic housing material looks the same.  Even so, examining the connectors under a microscope shows that I actually received three differently designed micro-USB connectors.  Two of the designs work well, but the third design, present on three cables, is faulty by design.For me, this charger is a great deal, but beware of unreliable cables!</text>

        <text>Finding my LG optimus phone when in heavy use sucks up the battery life I would find my self taking the cord and moving it to the car to recharge the battery when it was low, works well but seems that the cord would find itself inside the car when I was in the house and hearing the low battery sound I would have to go to the garage and unplug the cord and bring it back to the electric charger. Ordered 2 of these now i have one for the car one for my luggage and the original stays in the home.

        <text>I'm not sure about other phones, but for the Sprint HTC Mogul PPC-680 the sound doesn't come through to the 3.5mm jack.  There's a trick to do this, however.  Just remove or bend pin #1 on the diagram below, which is the pin closest to the diagonal corner of the USB port.  If you look closely at the USB port on your phone, you'll see that the other three corners are square.  Note that remove the pin from this cheap adapter, not your precious phone.The way I removed the pin was by using a sewing needle to pry the pin out of its location.  Then use a small flat screwdriver to push the pin all the way down inside the jack.I tried this on my Mogul with Windows Mobile 6.1, and it works great.  Now I can listen to my music via the tape adapter on my car or via my headphone (both having 3.5mm jack).

        <text>Just received my new best friend yesterday!I've recently been downloading alot of music to my phone and playing it throught my car stereo using an fm transmitter. What I wasn't able to do was keep my phone charged...since there is only one port on the G1. This device solved the problem!I plugged the headphone adapter chord that came with my G1 into the headphone port and my car charger into the charge/usb port of this device. It worked like a charm! I can now listen to pandora radio or the songs I have downloaded to my phone through my car stereo and not worry about draining my battery at all on those long trips. I also use it at work with my portable speakers.I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews with people having problems getting this to work and having to download programs, but I figured for the price it was worth a shot.

Your phone won't recognize the after market headphones that is plugged into it, unless you buy the "Sound Route Switcher" on the app market.Overall, it works great for roadtrips but, not good for taking on a walk or jogging.

        <text>I have been eyeing this phone for months watching for a price break, which finally happened last week. On top of that great deal, I am going to send my phone to Nokia Trade Up For Cash program, which means overall I have spent $200 on this really cool phone.I had Nokias my whole cell phone history and last year got a Motorola. I really did like my Z9 but it was almost obsolete from day 1 (but I really don't have anything bad to say about it, it was a good phone.) I missed Nokia with their simple menus and excellent quality.To be honest, the menus are no longer simple and sometimes seem counterintuitive LOL. And the touchscreen is a bit hard to use with the fingers like touching an iPhone (I have an iPod Touch so I was waffling between this phone and the iPhone). The touchscreen works very well with the included styli though. And my learning curve is getting better with touch, so I don't see it being a problem after a while. I think the accelerometer is faster than my Touch, almost too quick sometimes. The Music Player is the bomb! Way louder than my Touch and perfect clarity. It sounds amazing. I don't even need an additional speaker like I need for my Touch.The screen is gorgeous and so far setting up everything has gone well. I have my music transferred, my contacts transferred and am very happy. I like the compact size and heft of the phone. I don't like lightweight feeling phones. The camera seems fine to me. The battery life does seem to be on the shorter side but make sure you close web applications after use. The phone does so much that you can dejuice it quickly. My Touch does the same thing.Nokia definitely needs to step up with apps and also get the Music Store available for the US! Also if you message the downloads to yourself it is a pain, so it is better to download on the phone direct from the store. The App selection bites though, but that's what my ipod is for. The thrill of app-ness dies down anyway, so it's not really a big deal, but not having music store access is just silly.Otherwise this phone is very competitive to iPhone. Being upgradeable with its memory is a definite plus and you can even have many memory cards since it's hot swappeable, technically that is unlimited memory. I love my Touch of course but I got an 8g and I'm maxed out with music and apps and now I can't do anything to it unless I get rid of stuff. That kinda bites. So the 5800 has a true edge there.I already had AT&amp;T; and it was no problem to pop my SIM card in the phone and move right along. I had everything except the TV out cord and the stand which it appears on the website that they do not sell that in the package anymore so that is more Amazon's fault for not upgrading the info, but I don't really need the stand or cord. The USB cord is entirely too short. The headset comes in 2 pieces with a piece that can control the music and phone, which is very nice. Of course the charger is included and is acceptable. It easily connected with my internet, easily paired with my bluetooth, and once I finally figured out how to transfer music from my ipod to it, there were no problems there.I am very pleased with this phone and would recommend it for people who want a quality touchscreen phone and not necessarily an iPhone.PS I LOL at 8g holding 6000 songs. Maybe 6000 ringtone sound bytes. 8g will net you between 600-800 average songs....</text>

        <text>I've owned the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic since July 2009. Prior to the Nokia 5800 I had an old Nokia from 2005. I bought this because it had a decent video camera/camera(compared to my old Nokia) and the ability to browse the internet(my old Nokia could barely perform that function). After a year and a half, the results are mixed.The video cam is convenient to use but the results are just ok. In broad daylight the picture is clear. But in any other lighting condition degradation is rapid. Browsing the internet isn't that smooth because the 5800's touch-screen is either overly sensitive sometimes or it just takes a slegdehammer to register an input. This results in many mis-clicks which waste time and mobile bandwidth.The audio quality of the phone is pretty good. The switching function between horizontal and vertical screen is eratic and seems to switch to horizontal when I want it vertical and vertical when I need it horizontal, so I just turn off the auto-turn feature. Unfortunately there is no option to switch. Either it is stationary or it turns eratically on its own.With the updates the phone functions a little smoother. Originally there is the full/mini QWERTY keyboard along with handwriting, now with the update there is an alphanumeric keypad. The build-quality of the phone feels nice but it is a bit bulky and the little writing tool can easily get lost. Reception is always strong with this phone. Overall a decent phone that's a bit pricey and can be frustrating to use.</text>

        <text>This phone connected to the internet via WiFi yet gave me so many freezing problems both on and off the internet. I ended up with the Nokia 5530 and have had no freezing problems and am very happy with that phone. I cannot recommend the Nokia 5800 because of the freezing problems. And I did think the 5800 was a very pretty phone with big screen had it not been for those freezing problems...Oh well, life goes on! Glad now I own the Nokia 5530!</text>

        <text>I was sorry to see that what could have really given the iPhone a run for its money is actually trailing...Here is what I liked:1) Great sound! For a phone, the full body sound from its stereo speakers was amazing! Great for music, and as a speaker-phone.2) The size - fits very nicely in the hand. Body is plastic - but feels solid.3) Fastest GPS initialization I have ever seen in a portable 'period' let alone a phone-gps!4) Great video playback.5) Loved the handwriting recognition.Here are my dislikes:1) The Phone user interface is lacking. Especially if you use systems that require DTMF tones to operate. There were several occasions when even after getting the soft dialer on the screen, the digits did not send out the tones - on other occasions it did - I was not able to figure out what I was doing differently to get consistent behavior. The phone had to go back because of this.2) Applications just suck up power - if you use the phone for more than th e phone, you'll run short.3) Application hangups - podcasts downloaded caused the media player to get stuck. Had to cycle power to restore.4) Email application does not support HTML.5) No flash player6) WiFi selection is stupid... it does not automatically pick known wifi when in its proximity...7) Feels the phone could use more horsepower.I'm waiting for the N97...Cheers!</text>

        <text>I have used lots of different phones, from the basic Razr flip phone through several different Windows Mobile &amp; Blackberry smart phones, and even the greatly over-hyped iPhone, and this is by far my favorite phone!Symbian has a lot better performance and stability than Windows Mobile. The Nokia 5800 is more fun than a Blackberry. And the iPhone? Well, it's really just a "feature" phone (aka dumb phone) posing as a smart phone. The iPhone is great for what it can do, but terrible for what it can't do.The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is a truly useful and functional communication and entertainment device. It is the best convergence device I have used to date. It excels as a phone with great call quality and RF reception (I get 3G signals where other phones barely get 2G, or even no signal at all)! As a media device it features second to none audio quality (with good encoding and headphones it sounds incredible), and a truly amazing screen for photo viewing and video playback. And as a web/communication device it has one of the best mobile browsers available (full HTML with support for Java and Flash) with applications available for popular IM and social networking sites (ICQ, AIM, MSN, Yahoo, Jabber, IRC, Googletalk, Skype, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter and more) and email with support for attachments (POP, IMAP, SMTP, MFE). And since it's all controlled by the Symbian multi-tasking OS, you can use just about any combination of applications and features you want (within the limits of the phone's memory)!Nokia has been supporting this phone well with several major (free) firmware updates since it was released late last year. Be sure to update to the latest firmware, because there have been significant improvements in performance and stability, as well as new features added.It's small and light weight with reasonably solid construction. While it is a little thicker than some other touch screen phones, it is also narrower and has a very nice fit and feel in hand while not being overly bulky in your pocket.It's about as loaded as you can get feature wise. Besides what I mentioned above, it's got tactile (Haptic) feedback. Accelerometer. GPS with A-GPS and navigation software (Nokia/Ovi Maps). Dual-band high speed HSDPA 3.5G (WCDMA 850/1900 MHz) and multi-band international calling support (GSM/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 MHz). WiFi 802.11g network support. 3.2MP camera with auto-focus, dual-LED flash and video recording (plus a 2nd front camera for video calling). FM Radio! Media player (audio &amp; video) with "Flight" mode for use during airline travel. Photo browser. Multiple input options (full screen QWERTY, mini QWERTY, T9 with predictive text, and handwriting recognition). Expandable memory (microSDHC 8GB included, can accept larger cards as well). User changeable battery. Really loud and surprisingly good sounding speakers. 3.5mm Nokia AV connector (for standard stereo headphones and audio/video TV output). Bluetooth 2.0 with support for Stereo audio (A2DP &amp; AVRCP). Speed dial. Voice dialing (SIND speaker independent dialing and voice commands). PC sync software.The 5800 XM runs on Symbian S60 v5, a true multi-tasking smart phone OS. But because Nokia markets this as an XpressMusic phone, you can use it with AT&amp;T;'s cheap medianet data plans, or just use WiFi without any data plan at all if you prefer (I've got unlimited data for $10/month on the family plan).You simply cannot beat this phone's combination of features, performance and price!</text>

    <sentence id="8384">
        <text>This is a simple intuitive phone to use. The touchscreen is very responsive. The display is absolutely gorgeous. Web browsing is a tremendous experience if you use Operamini 5. Call quality is very clear. I could not ask for better reception. The Music player is good. The phone feels very solid and firm in my hand. The battery is not as strong as my N79 or N78, but it lasts a day, with very heavy web browsing (3-4 hours). That's probably due to the touchscreen. Videos play very well. Again, picture quality is magnificent.This is a very powerful phone that takes time to learn and get the most out of. So, be patient and read the manual. I say this because there are more things you can do with this phone than you can imagine. At the current price this phone is a bargain. It feels a little heavy, especially when one is lying in bed, surfing the web, but not excessively so. I'm an entrepreneur, so I use this phone for business and for my own personal entertainment. Bluetooth works fine. From reading some of the negative reviews here, I think some people have not taken the time to learn how to operate this phone. I can't compare the touchscreen to Apple because I have never owned an Apple product. But I can say unequivocally that the touchscreen on the 5800 works extremely well. Some apps require a single touch, others require a double touch. After a while, it comes natural what to do. After owning a N78 and N79, I can say the touchscreen is a big improvement over a physical keypad with buttons.After using this touchscreen, I'm not sure if I can ever go back and embrace a more traditional phone again.</text>

        <text>I am really impressed with this phone. This is not an iphone so don't expect the features of an iphone. The Name Nokia itself gives you the assurance that the phone has to be a good quality and it is. The phone has great features like wifi, Very good camera (two cameras), touch screen, and many applications. There is Nokia OVI Maps built in which gives you access to maps anytime even if your phone is not connected to internet. You have to go online and download the maps for your state that you want. It does have one month of GPS included. The touch screen is not bad, but you sometimes have to use the tip of your finger as the area to touch are small. Once you get the phone you have to update the software or else you will be having weaker scrolling and weaker touch sensitivity. The update wasn't easy as the settings were all incorrect. I had to Google the right settings before i was able to update. The calendar is a good feature, but it looks like a weaker calendar compared to the previous versions of this phone. The screen lock feature is great as it is on the side of the phone. The phone is not really thin as it should be. It does not have keyboards so you would expect it to be thinner. The Sim card is very hard to remove as you have to remove the battery. The memory card is very difficult to remove as well. The music player is great. The thing that i hate about this phone is while you are talking on the phone to a customer service and they ask you to press 1 for yes or 2 for no, you don't have keypad to enter that. You have to go to options and open dialer to enter this. This makes it difficult while dialing any customer service numbers. Overall this a a very good phone with a lot of features and a trusted brand name. The weakness is the touch is not too intuitive.</text>

        <text>I loved the way Nokia designed its first mobile touchscreen phone. The purchase was a gift for my wife secretly. She was impressed when she discovered the multimedia experience and web browsing it has. Of course, the OVI share experience to upload all her photos and receive comments from her friends and family, was what made her happy. This smartphone has everything required for a practical use of email, e-mail account wizards settings are very easily to use, and with the OVI suite you can have it all in one place. Multitask System Symbian 5th Edition is really the strength of this model, which allows to do many things at once. The only detail known is the battery consumption.</text>

        <text>I've had this phone now for a little over a month.  I can tell you that after using it for this length of time that it is an excellent phone.  It can do more than any other touchscreen phone out there today.  The only two phones that can even come close are the iPhone 3G and the BB Storm.  This phone can do more than either of them two.  The camera gets dogged a lot, but in all actuality, it does a pretty good job when taking pictures in bright outdoor/indoor light.  The front facing camera is an outstanding feature and works very well.  The Video (which iPhone does not have at this time) is very exceptional as well; even more functional and better quality than the camera still shots (odd eh?).  The virtual qwerty is very nice and has all the keys in the right place. I also have an Eternity, but the layout of the 5800's keyboard is way better (don't make me dig for my apostrophe Samsung!) &gt;:[.  Also, the haptic feedback is awesome too.  The vibration actually 'feels' localized and not just vibrating the whole phone.  The call quality is top notch, not sure why some reviews say other wise, but compared to previous phones I have owned, this was on par with my old Nokia E51, and better than my Eternity, Quickfire (what a joke), SE w580i or LG Vu.  I've had other phones too, but they were very basic phones and were also Nokias.The OS is still a tad bit immature, making its crossover to the touchscreen.  However, it is still very stable and functional for its 'immaturity'.  I love how they managed to keep all the previous capabilities of the S60 3rd and include it into a very well packaged bundle what is now called S60 5th Edition.  I love the 'tap and hold and slide' to copy and paste things.  It is so awesome!Syncing is great as usual.  I downloaded the iSync plug from Nokia website and was able to sync my calendar and contacts via bluetooth flawlessly!  Also, PC Suite worked like a charm as with any Nokia phone.The sound is best in class.  I don't think anything out there can compete with the sound quality that this phone puts out.It's still a new phone, been out only about 7 months now.  But they provide excellent firmware support (3 to date) and are constantly looking for ways to improve performance and enhance any existing features if not, they even add more useful features.As for all the other features (gps, radio, messaging, browsing); it does them all very well.  I have no complaints.  Probably the only drawback if there were one, is the fact that this phone can do so much with its Symbian OS that you really need to read up and research all the things it can really do and how to do them.  This phone's OS has a very rich Symbian ancestry.It's an excellent phone and I honestly believe that this phone is best in class and overall compared to the other phones currently out there.  I would even go so far as to say I am glad I did not wait for the N97.  I know blasphemy!  But it's true.If you get this phone, you will not regret it.  Just keep in mind that it does come with plenty of features and the OS is very 'sophisticated'.  Oh, by the way, I do have to admit, that it is very nice to have a 'Smart Phone' that can use the internet and check email without having to pay any PDA fees.Kudos Nokia!  Keep it up!</text>

        <text>I decided to pick up an unlocked phone to go with my AT&amp;T; service rather than go into another 2 year contract.  After months of deciding on IPhone or something different, I came to the conclusion that the missing features of the Iphone were too much for me.  I needed multi-media messaging, video recording capabilities and a better camera.  I also wanted the ability to change batteries at some point as I've had bad luck with devices that had built in batteries.  So I ruled out Iphone and went on a search for the perfect phone.  While I can easily say that there is no such thing as a perfect phone, the Nokia 5800 comes close.  I was going to wait until the N97 was released but the $600 or $700 price tag was too much to take.  I ended up buying the 5800 from Amazon at a reasonable $302 which was the same cost as the 16gb Iphone minus the 2 year contract.What I like about the phone:1. It has everything I need that the Iphone was missing including very good video recording capabilities.2. The Bluetooth works well with my car and head set.  No difference in sound and everything is very clear.3. Music Player is clean and clear but it could be a bit louder.4. Web browsing works well although not as smooth as the Iphone5. Flash support!!!!  Yes, you can watch youtube videos on it6. Amazon On Demand $50 gift certificate - While I don't see myself using the phone to watch movies, this was a nice treat and it looks very sharp on the screen7. Battery life is great compared to other phones that have these features and can be replaced8. Access to any type of e-mail including Exchange support9. The full digital keyboard is easy to use with the stylus (a bit tough for those of us with fat fingers!)10. Ability to use apps such as QIK which allows you to stream video for live sharing (very cool feature)11. Customer support from Nokia has been top notch for me12. Expandable memory - comes with 8GB card and I expanded it to 16GB.  I've heard through the grapevine that it can also handle the new 32gb SD cards that just came outLast but definitely not least13.  Multi tasking!  Listen to music while tracking your fitness and browsing the web.  No problem....well except for the actual working out part!What I think needs improvement1.  Camera takes incredible pictures in bright light but is brutal in low light situations.  Supposedly firmware V.21 helps this problem but it is not available in the U.S. yet2.  Limited Apps available compared to Iphone.  Not a big deal but it would be nice if Nokia can get their App store up and running beyond the limited themes and music tones out there right now3.  Firmware Updates - U.S. versions seem to be last on the list since no major carriers over here carry this phone.  Waiting for V.21......4.  Touch screen is fairly responsive but could use some additional customization for sensitivity5.  There is a learning curve for the Symbian software that runs the phone - Not as intuitive as the Iphone but once you get the hang of it is not too bad6.  Web browser - yes, it is one of the things I like but it also has some flaws with navigation.  Iphone got this one right and no one else has gotten closeOverall, in my opinion, this is one of the best phones on the market under $400.  I think the N97 coming out will be the king of phones but I doubt it will break into any major U.S providers since it would compete directly with Iphone, Storm, Pre, etc...  It's too bad for Nokia that they are left out and that means too bad for U.S owners of their phones since we get all the newest firmware releases last (if at all).  I don't see myself changing phones anytime soon as the 5800 seems to have everything I need for now.  Maybe if 4G or 5G or whatever is next on the horizon becomes available, I will consider changing.  For now, this is my choice.*****Update May 27, 2009*******Great news!!  The Nokia App store is now live (store.ovi.com).  I now feel like I have a complete phone as I can easily download apps and have them installed.  Prior to yesterday, the only way to get apps was to search for them on various sites, forums and other places.  The installs were always hit or miss and I could never tell if the app was compatible with the 5800.Now, with the new app store, I feel like the one thing missing has been fixed.  The number of apps seems to be very large upon the initial opening.  I heard that something like 20,000 apps were supposed to be released on launch day but there is no easy way to know how many are really out there.Prices seem a little bit higher than the IPhone store.  There are a good amount of free apps but the ones that cost money seem to range anywhere from $2.99 to $20.You can either shop the store on your computer and send a text link to you device or you can download the OVI app which will automatically connect you to the app store.Hopefully the amount of GOOD apps that are released will increase fast now that the store is open.  In my mind, the only benefit of the IPhone was the apps...but that it now in the past.Oh, and it seems like us U.S owners are getting abit more support.  The App updater works now and I was able to update to the newest version of Flash Lite which could only be done in the past through firmware updates. And speaking of firmware, I haven't checked to see if V.21 is available in the U.S. yet but tech support seemed to goof up a bit last week when they told me to download it to fix a minor issue I was having.  When I told them I couldn't see the update, they quickly corrected themselves and told me to keep checking.  So hopefully any day now!!Finally, I love this phone so much that I just picked up a second one for my wife.  With the $50 rebate, that puts the price to below $300 which is just amazing compared to what the IPhone would cost coupled with PDA monthly data charges. The 5800 is the winner.</text>

        <text>I do not usually write reviews, but I like this phone so much that I felt I should write one.  First, I normally would not buy a Nokia - I am a Sony Ericsson fan. However, I needed a quad-band  phone for a trip to Europe and I wanted a touch phone. The SE Satio has been released, but not in the USA and it is pricey.  So I went with the Nokia. I love the look and feel of the phone.  I have had absolutely no problems - no screen freezing and battery life has been very very good.  The battery charges quickly. It is easy to lock and unlock the phone manually.  There is an automatic lock feature which you can disable or set a longer time before it automatically locks.  Calls are easy and call quality is great.  A prior reviewer said it is to hard to make a call, but I do not find that to be the case. You can put pics or an icon for people you call frequently (I think up to 5) on the start screen or set up a speed dial number. I find it easy to use the touch screen but you do need to apply some pressure - more than the iPhone, but it works great.  I am not a big web user but it connects quickly.  I have not tried the GPS yet. I do have to say the camera is not so great, so if you are looking for a good camera phone I would not buy this phone.  Also, I do not know why the phone icon is found in applications and not on the main menu (maybe I can change that). I am still learning to use all of the many features this phone has to offer.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced phone with lots of features, you should definitely consider the Nokia 5800.</text>

        <text>JANUARY 2010 UPDATE:  After having used the Nokia for a week, decided on returning it because of the short battery life and then even with an updated firmware, the screen became unresponsive needing turning off and on again the device in order to use the phone features.  As much as I like Nokia, they still have a long way to go with touch screens.INITIAL REVIEW: After one year using a Nokia E-71 which I dropped and stopped working, I searched for a replacement and found this XpressMusic5800 for $219.00 OnLine.  Ordered it from the blue computer store and have been "playing with it" for only 24 hours.  Nevertheless, being a recently introduced device in the US, thought on sharing my first impression for those who are considering it.Users familiar with Nokia products will love how user friendly this phone is.  Those unfamiliar with Nokia, might have a hard time setting up the many phone's features but it's worth your time.  Once you open the box, will find a device much smaller than what you thought it would be.  The most attractive thing is how narrow it is.  Slightly shorter than an I-Phone and E-71, much narrower than both but somewhat thicker; a tad more than half inch.  Included is a wired remote control for the player, mic/headphones, the wall charger, strap, MicroSD card and a mini disk for installing the Nokia features.On the upper part of the device there is a micro USB dock, the port for the regular headset, the charging port and the on/off switch. On the right side there is a volume switch, the unlocking switch and a separate camera switch.  The left side houses an 8GB MicroSD card (included) and the SIM Card from your phone carrier.  The expected Nokia strap hooks on the lower left side of the phone.  The battery is on the back, facing downwards and to access it you need to remove the whole back cover.  The phone comes in shiny black which is a fingerprints magnet.When you turn it on it vibrates, shows the usual Nokia welcome and then allows you to program it.  I was able to configure my two main e-mails but guess you can do several more.  On my E-71 I had four different mail accounts constantly receiving messages.  The native wallpaper is black with some waves but you can easily change it to your favorite photo.  I downloaded several screens from the Apple website since the screen is somewhat similar to the I-Phone and I-Pod in shape and dimensions.On a very T-Mobile way, you can have your "four favorite people" on the main screen and once you touch their corresponding picture/icon, the phone shows a history of calls made, received, text messages and e-mails; quite innovative.  On the lower area you have an icon for phone dialing and another for your contacts.  The phone dialing keyboard works only in the vertical position but the font keyboard is accessed also while the device is horizontal.  Making a call trough the contact list is very easy the device is loaded with features.Call quality is excellent and even at its loudest setting there is no distortion.  The touch sensing screen is not as fast and accurate as the Apple devices but good enough for not needing the stylus that is housed on the rear of the phone.  As a music player it is outstanding.  Playback is trough the two micro speakers on the lower sides and sound quality as well as stereo separation are very good.  Nokia offers on this device all the goodies that make them unique such as saying the caller's name/ID, unique caller ringtones &amp; photos and several customizable user modes. There are many features that I have not yet tried but will do during the next week or so.  My service is with ATT and works in both frequencies; EDGE &amp; 3-G,Now, the limitations of the Nokia 5800:First; the battery life.  Nokia products have been famous for their extended batteries.  My E-71 could be used without recharging up to three days.  On the 5800, the battery drains in six hours. The stated four hours of talk time and two weeks of standby time are far from reasonable.What I did to prolong battery life was disable the vibrations when the screen gets a command, disable the 3-G (use EDGE only) and made the Bluetooth available for search for only one minute.  As of today, with regular calls, internet use, e-mails and music, after 15 hours of nonstop use, the battery still has like 40% charge.Second and quite disappointing, the installation mini disk as well as the software upgrades on the Nokia Website is not compatible with Windows 7.  After downloading all the suites, OVI, and ancillary software, many of these do not work with Win-7. Then tried these with a NetBook running Win-XP and no problem with the updates.Having stated all this, I consider that for the price paid ($219.00), the Nokia 5800 is a bargain when compared with their 51XX and 53XX series, mostly because of its music playing capabilities, awesome call features and quality.  But in my case, the battery issue might make me consider other alternate phones.  Let's see what I decide and meanwhile, I hope that this initial review helps you to decide if the Nokia 5800 is the phone for you.  In case that you are considering an I-Phone, you should wait. The new, smaller and slim I-Phone 4-G goes on sale in June 2010.</text>

        <text>I bought my Nokia 5800 XM from Amazon &amp; used the free shipping option. It arrived at my APO address here in Kuwait in 5 DAYS!What a deal!The phone is great, &amp; easy to figure out &amp; use. The only bad thing was the memory card came with some music samples /folders on it which I could not delete. I could delete the songs, but not the file folder. An error message would appear saying that the file was corrupted. Finally I formatted the memory card &amp; that erased all the preloaded junk on it. Now I have only my stuff on the card so... format the card BEFORE adding anything to it!Aside from having to do that, it's a great phone, lots of features, basically everything I'll ever need &amp; much more.

        <text>Phone features are very nice.  However after a few months, it started to shutdown without warning (battery was charged) and sometimes, when this happens, it would erase the entire contents.  I've contacted amazon's customer service several days ago asking what I should do, and did not receive any replies.  Despite the fact that this is a nice phone, it's better to buy a more sturdy one.UPDATE: I've contacted Nokia USA which confirmed the phone is under warranty and asked to ship the phone to be serviced.  They returned the phone with the same problem.  I contacted their customer service and they asked to send the phone again.  Waiting for the outcome, hopefully the phone will be really fixed this time.</text>

        <text>No reason to say about its features, it is more than known and published everywhere on internet, it is simply great!

        <text>I love this phone. The touch screen is just right, too much but tolerable garbage programs on it by Nokia that you cannot remove. Decent but not great call quality. I thought I would not like stylus but really like its accuracy. Surfing the web (on ATT) is great with this phone. Its biggest problem is dropping calls, shutting down, acting like "memory overflow" when browsing the web and shutting down the browser. These problems cured temporarily by removing battery. The more you use it the more often you must pull battery to reboot. Mine is going back to Nokia for warranty repair tomorrow. Hope that helps. It came with V20  software, upgraded to V21, but Nokia won't release the V30 software in US yet. Who knows, that may cure problem, but first they will have to spend their factory dollars to investigate since they won't give U.S. new software. Last Nokia I will ever buy. There must be a company that can make a phone with good hardware and/or software??? I wish it worked......  UPDATE 9-3-09: ZPhone was having so many problems, sent it in to their REPAIR depot. It came back in ONLY 6 DAYS and has worked PERFECTLY since. They noted they "replaced crystal filter". I really like this phone and feel it is perfect now. It does make me want a larger screen and the new 4 inch devices being released are very tempting (when we can buy them unlocked). I hope they are are good as this phone for usability. Will consider other Nokias based on their repair service.</text>

        <text>hi, first lets setup my parameters. I am a Tmobile subscriber from Tampa Bay area.  My reception is the highest available. I have owned in order a Ericson from the PCS days, a Panasonic from ATT/Cingular days, Nokia 6120, 6131, Tmobile Dash, Tmobile Shadow, Nokia N95 8GB (for 3 weeks but then the display went out and i got scared to want to replace it so i returned it. Please also note this is my second time owning a Nokia 5800. The first time was a European model with US warranty since i got it from the Nokia Flagship store in Chicago. That had the first firmware with no updates...and it sucked. Sucked so bad I sold it used because I couldnt wait for the firmware upgrade. So now we advance to today. And with great relief, I tell you people that this Nokia 5800 Nam is an outstanding smartphone.  The most current firmware 20.0.012 has made this Nok great. I know this because I have owned both.  I take off .50 because no the UI is not as pretty as the Iphone, nothing is when it comes to touch. the other .25 is because when you activate the pretty animations for the touch interface, it does slow it down. So I do turn it off to keep it running smoothly.  This is a best seller for Nokia, therefore they will continue to give us better software updates to make it run even smoother.  Their is no crazy ear piece problem.  The phone feels so easy fitting in one hand.  This cant be said of the Iphone.  The Iphone is awsome yes, but its kinda big to use as a cellphone. ok let me real this in. The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen.  As for the touch method, the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is CLEARLY improved and does not hold you back. Clearly the firmware upgrade tweaked the sensitivity and made it much more responsive.  im all over the place with this review, im sorry. if only Nokia could do better marketin partnerships and get this to a local Best Buy so people can touch it and feel how great it is...that for me is one of it biggest selling points...</text>

        <text>IMPORTANT NOTE:  This phone is carrier-unlocked.  It means that the phone itself does not require you to go with any one specific carrier in order to use it:  you just buy it, swap your SIM card (if compatible), and start using.  HOWEVER: if you are not currently on an unlimited data plan with your carrier, you absolutely MUST call your wireless carrier and talk to them about the phone.  The Nokia XpressMusic 5800 has a lot of settings that default to using your wireless carrier to pull down data, and using these features (or in some cases just having them turned on) when your carrier bills you for data by the kilobit WILL lead to astronomically high phone bills.  I had a long conversation with AT&amp;T; Service prior to purchasing this phone and their representative indicated to me that many people don't realize the hidden cost of their phone's features when not signed up for an unlimited data plan.  Before you buy, take 10 minutes to call your carrier.  It can save you a lot of headaches.The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is an excellent phone for people who love media: it's got a browser for streaming, easy-to-use software for transfers of your own files, and it even has a built-in FM radio for listening to local stations (with the added bonus of being able to tag and label them). The screen is approximately the size of the screen on a Nintendo DS or the older Sony PSP, with the difference being that colors are brighter, resolution is sharper, and the backlight is superior. Power button, standard headphone adapter, charge plug and USB connector are all on the top, making it easy to access but conveniently out of the way. The touch screen is unlocked via a rocker key on the side, and volume can easily be adjusted up or down along the same edge.In addition to this, you can expect all the same features you find in most smartphones today: GIS-driven mapping systems, Internet connectivity via WiFi (if, like me, you're not on an unlimited data plan), a multitude of Bluetooth capabilities, integration with a PC or Mac via the USB Cable, and of course a digital camera that takes good (but not great) pictures and video. One nice extra here is that if you hold the phone like a camera, a button on top will quickly switch the phone to camera mode and also double as your auto-focus and picture-taking button.I like the feel of this phone, and I definitely like the clarity and strength of the calls. There are times when it appears that I have only one bar, but still can place clear and noise-free calls that don't disconnect. The software is regularly kept up to date, and once you get through the process of setting up an account at the Ovi Store, it is remarkably easy to download and install applications, many of which are free (but only some of which are useful).The one big drawback--and it is a serious one--is the interface. Features and Applications are in two separate sections, and sometimes the dividing line between which is which is not exactly clear. The auto-rotate that switches from Portrait to Landscape can go off at the slightest of bumps, and I have to shake the phone and wait for it to re-set. I bought the phone because I wanted a good, solid handwriting device, and this is where I have been most disappointed. Despite being a whiz at PDAs, despite training (and re-training) the phone to my handwriting, I get many botched translations. I have to force myself to scribe slowly because the delay time between reading my strokes and rendering a character is noticeably long. I have to patiently re-do most of my strokes over and over. To give credit where credit is due, Nokia gives you a slim stylus cleverly hidden along the side of the phone, and then they throw in a hip little gadget called a "plectrum": it's a triangular guitar-pick that makes a handy substitute for a fingernail--consider this for pointing and clicking and the stylus for handwriting.There is, however, one sin that seems unforgivable, and I'm surprised that a year and a half down the road, the updates still haven't addressed it:The phone dialer has no letters on it.Let me rewind that: if you call up the dialer in other areas of the phone (such as via contacts), you will see the letters imprinted on the dial pad. However, if you want to dial a number with letters in it (say, "1-800-FLOWERS"), you are out of luck: the dialer shown when dialing the phone does not display any letters. The fact that the letters are imprinted elsewhere in the system, but not where they are most important, is what makes the lack of this "fix" annoying.Also, while the software is easy to use, it is also incredibly slow and buggy in Windows Vista or Windows 7. The interface often turns black and I have to scrub my mouse over the window to re-draw my menus and panels.If you really like media and want a phone for music, pictures, and video, the 5800 XpressMusic is not bad. However, if you're looking for a pocket-sized computer that can do whiz-kid propeller-head tricks, the 5800XpressMusic will most likely disappoint, especially given its price. As much as I appreciate what Nokia was trying to do with this phone, it really wasn't significantly different from my Motorola RAZR.NOTE: I cannot confirm that this is true of all Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phones, but the "USA" Phone that was shipped to me contained a European power adapter. This huge chunk of plastic contains a converter to allow it to plug into US electrical outlets, but it also means that your charger is anything but pocket-sized. I sent mine in for a replacement, only to discover that the replacement also contained the same "Euro-plus-converter-widget" charger.</text>

        <text>Oh Boy, where do I start a review for this product.I saw this product on Sale at Dell website and overly impressed with the specs and the reviews on Amazon - almost immediately I ordered one for myself and just about to order another one for my wife.  I put it on hold till I try out one of them - glad that I did not order the 2nd one.Initially I did not like the idea of going for a $30 data plan with At&amp;t; and being stuck to a service provider for 2 long years and badly wanted to buy something with no data plan.Let me break down each of the feature functionality of this product in detail - it is probably the most detailed review you will find on this product.  First the good part and then the bad stuffAs a phone - receive/make calls  :  10/10===============================Full marks to Nokia as a phone - the phone has excellent signal reception, compared to any of the smart phones out there in the market.  I have used a blackberry/iphone/samsung and Nokia score above allCamera (stills) : 5/10===============Camera is good for outdoors, but very poor for indoors - the photos look very grainy.  Front camera is decent and you can use it to make video calls with your friends running fring on their iPhone/Android and other nokiaCamera (video) : 7/10===============Video quality is excellent, I have shot a few videos outdoors and almost compares to HD qualityCamera/Video/Front/Rear switch : 2/10==============================Since the phone feature video, stills, front &amp; rear camera: Switching from a video to still and back to video.  Switching from front to rear camera and back is so difficult and non-intuitive.  I am a pretty good geek with stuff and I found it extremely difficult and confusing to switch between different modes.Calender, Memo... : 5/10======================Can sync with Exchange on your computer, but cannot sync directly with exchange servers unlike android/iphones which can directly connect to your company servers.  Which means, everytime, you need to connect the phone to the computer for syncMusic player/Video : 7/10==================Music player output is very good, lacks a audio book player.  It does not playback divx movies (sorry torrent folks :)Youtube playback: 2/10================Ok, I thought I will be able to use this to play youtube videos to entertain my daughter while driving we are driving.  I was not able to play even a single youtube video without pauses and jerks, made several attempts and finally gave up.Read on the forums and some suggested me to use the desktop version &amp; try it on wifi - But even on Wifi, while it is better than 2g/3g - it is still disgusting playback speed.I was very disappointed with this whole youtube playback partYahoo/Gmail access : 3/10==================Imagine that you open a mail and it comes up as  new mail  &amp;lt;href image= ....&gt;This phone does not even support html emails, no images either.  Other than that, the good part is that it does a pretty good job of syncing with Gmail &amp; Yahoo and downloads the emailsKeyboard  : 7/10=========The keyboard was a bit impressive - you have 3 options - mini keyboard, full size keyboard or you can write in your handwriting.  I liked to input text with the full size keyboard as this one was the most convenient.Apps  : 2/10====Yes, there is an app store, but it the store is so poorly organized and very user unfriendly that you would end up spending hours to find the right app for you.Next the apps itself - there are some decent apps available for gaming and productivity, but if you have used any android/iPhone app - you will realize that Nokia is waaaaay to behind in the game.Touch Screen: 3/10=====================First of all this is a resistive touch screen, means you need to actually put pressure on the screen for it to work, unlike the modern day capacitive touch screen which will only need you to just touch and the screen will pick up static charges from your fingers.So the Nokia's resistive touch screen works, but it is very poor in response - you will almost always need the accompanying stylesRadio : 3/10======It does have a radio, but it will not play unless you plug in the headset which acts as a antenna.  Even after plugging in the antenna, it picks up a few strong signals, but did not pick up some of the weaker signals neither indoors, nor outdoors.GPS  ; 4/10====I have a 3 year old GPS from garmin and I thought I will throw it out after I get a Nokia.  Oh oh, big mistake.  The Nokia phone comes with a assisted GPS (means it does triangulation with satellites as well as with cell phone towers.While the phone does a good job of finding your current location, it is extremely poor in finding directions and reading out the street names and directions.  It works, but it is no where near to a regular GPS or a built in GPS like the ones in iphone/android=========== summary =============Honestly, I have never felt this frustrated with any phone in my life- when I really wanted to love this so much.Nokia - where art thou ? come down from your ivory tours and give us a good phone.  We do not want to be stuck up in the vicious circle of At&amp;t; and apple - we want unlocked phones and we do not want to see crappy phones like this from you.  Pls wake up.</text>

        <text>Truth is, I was pre-sold by current users of these things on several droid and HTC Incredible forums I frequent; enough so that I bought three at this ridiculously low price.  I've only been using my first set for about six hours, and most of that has been getting "quality opinions" from those that I trust while using them on my Incredible in several situations that I encounter regularly.Everyone I called, without exception, literally raved about the quality of my "sound", and several compared it to the very best land-line connection they've experienced.  On the receive end, the default volume setting when I plugged them in was almost to the point of pain; I had to turn the volume nearly off for comfortable listening, so there would be absolutely no problem using these in very noisy places (at least on my end).  I like the fact that without the silicone earbud option, they're still comfortable for extended wear, but you have nearly normal hearing when they're set at a reasonable level, so driving safety is not hampered.  If I wanted to block out any other sounds, I'd use my expensive noise canceling headphones, but my intent for these was mostly hand-free phone use; being able to hear traffic, sirens, etc can be a huge safety bonus!If there is a flaw to this ridiculously-cheap headset, it's the fact that the microphone is not noise canceling. My work van is noisy at highway speeds, and I did get reports of hearing a "roar" in the background (but that listener did point out that there was no problem with him to be able to understand me perfectly; it was just that the background noise was "distracting" when I wasn't talking.  I did slow down to about 35 mph as a test, and that background noise "went away".Although my Incredible, until the new software update that's coming soon, doesn't support voice dialing, it does have a "voice search" feature with one button push on the "Car Panel"...  ...I've found that the extra-clear audio of this headset resulted in perfect, mistake-free name recognition with that program, and error-free dialing in at least a half-dozen test calls.After the great reports I've gotten during my full evening of "testing", I'm parking my Bluetooth for most applications; so far, I haven't found the cord to be a problem when my phone's in it's holster or in the windshield mount. (I could possibly change my mind about that after a few weeks of use, but the superior quality achieved with this headset is worth a little extra hassle with a cord.)When contact after contact kept telling me that they've never had a better, clearer, telephone conversation (and far superior to my Incredible when "hand held" in its normal mode, I plan to place every call I can with this headset!By the way, the music quality is also very good with this headset, way superior to anything within $25 or so of this price.Can you tell I'm excited and enthused? :-)I've had so many truly "rotten" conversation with people on cell phones during the past 40 years; "if I were King", I'd mandate that everyone who called me used this product.</text>

        <text>I have wanted a sidekick for a couple years and finally found this one for under $50, and I didn't have to extend my contract. I opened the box, put the battery in, my sim card and SD card and it worked.Over the past couple days I have made a list of the pros and cons.Pro:It has a real cool screen with awesome color that swivels open and made everyone at work say Ooooo!Cons:* I think there are more buttons than you need, many are repetitious, but they look impressive. Most of the functions take several steps. I work with computers and accessories all day, I am not intimidated by something different. But this was not a well thought out design.* A tiny button on the top opens the camera. It's a very tiny black button, flat to the surface and the same color as the phone so its hard to find and difficult to push, I used my fingernail when I found it. You can take both photos and video. I somehow got the camera into video mode and it took a while to get it back to photo. The picture it took was good quality.* There are no one step calls as with other phones. There are several ways to make a call which I won't go through, but it is neither easy nor convenient. The swivel screen is in the way when making a phone call. The basic function of a cell phone should be making calls quick and easy. The Sidekick gets an "F" for that. And the same grade for reception. My last phone, a very basic and inexpensive phone, gets reception in places this one can't receive or make a call, like in my house.* I don't think this phone should be categorized under slider, I have a slider and closing it is a simple one hand move. This doesn't slide, it swivels.* With all the functions they have available, there is only one alarm.* I had TMobile turn on data so I could download features I need like another alarm, but The phone was never able to access the Internet so I cancelled that service.* It makes loud annoying sounds for whatever you do, opening the screen, keystrokes and just about everything. So I adjusted the settings to silent and turned the ring volume up, a multi step process through the menu. When I am at work I turn the volume down, then later when I turn the volume up, it resets all the sounds back on.* Texting is not easy to access, another multi step process. Getting texts is in a whole different location than writing a new text.* There are many buttons, and some just duplicate what others do. It looks impressive, but that's all.* The screen and buttons are not customizable so there is no way to set up one step shortcuts for features you use often.Everything that other phones do with a simple one or two steps, this phone requires attention to what you are doing and has multiple steps many starting from the menu. Doing almost anything with this phone is like carrying your PC around, and trying to get into programs without shortcuts on the desktop.This is not a phone you can hand to a friend and tell them, here, use my phone. You either have to dial for them, or hand them the users manual. Which in this case is a DVD.</text>

        <text>I think this is a great phone. As mentioned, the Danger network is no longer available, therefore some of the features don't work. But for the low price and the quality of the phone, it's well worth it. The screen swivels open smoothly. Colors are vibrant. Instructional cd is a great help for some of the trickier features. And T-Mobile is always eager to help. I was able to copy my sim card address book over easily. So until I qualify for a new phone on my t-mobile plan, this phone will do just fine and be fun to use too.My only dissappointment I will mention is the memory card was not included in the packaging. I read that in someone elses review and emailed Amazon before my phone shipped and they confirmed that it would be present. But it wasn't. :( Its mentioned in the advertisement as being part of the package. So be aware of that. Although Amazon has kindly offered to compensate me, I would have just preferred the memory card to be included.Update- Amazon has given me a little bigger refund which allowed me to purchase the memory card seperately. Thank you Amazon!</text>

        <text>When I had my 3gs I would always go through screen protectors. This pack of 3 really was a great buy for the price and served it purpose. They aren't the best out there, but they did their job. I upgraded my phone to the iphone 5 and now I'm done with flimsy plastic screen protectors. I use the Spigen Glas.T screen shield. Wow!!! Its like not having anything on it at all and you get excellent protection. I will never go back to a thin plastic screen protector ever again.</text>

    <sentence id="8436">
        <text>these work very well if you use extreme prejudice in dust removal prior to installation. have gone through a couple; they are thin and tough. improved touch sensitivity over the Otterbox protector as the OBx a thicker plastic. it last for several months, (up to a year), so a good value, and I can use the screen with thin gloves on, not so with the OBx. As a builder my work environment tends to get dusty a lot, i like these.</text>

    <sentence id="8447">
        <text>I consider myself fairly adept at applying screen protectors to Apple devices, having done it several dozen times now.I've knocked a star off these for the simplest of reasons: As with all these 'screen protectors' there are two stickers covering the actual screen protector which are removed in order; #1 before you apply it to your screen and #2 after it is applied. The problem with this bunch is that the "Peel here" for #1 is located at the top of the screen. As I aligned the screen protector beginning with the speaker, it fell short of the home button, and had to be re-applied. If you've done this before, you know that the 'bad' bubbles that form (the impossible to remove bubbles) are due to tiny dust particles that adhere to the 'sticky' protector during application. Several tiny pieces of dust will ruin a protector during application.I have a few essential tips to alleviate some of the common mistakes:1) Clear an area to apply the protector on a workable surface. We use a glass table in our living room.2) Wipe the area with 409 or windex, removing all dust and debris.3) Allow airborne dust in the area to subside. Don't do anything that will stir up dust.4) Wash your hands thoroughly and dry them thoroughly.5) Gather the necessary tools for the application. (I use one of the "plastic plying tools" (found in a kit such asComplete Tool Screw Driver Torx Kit to Repair Replace Apple Iphone 2g 3g GPS Ipod Video Nano Touch Cracked Scratch Broken Lcd Screen Displaybecause I find the smaller surface area of the tip better than a credit card)6) Begin at the bottom or Home Button side of the phone.7) NEVER TOUCH the unprotected side of the screen protector once sticker #1 has been removed8) If you misalign the piece during application it is possible to grip the protector by the very edges.9) Be extremely careful not to drop, lose grip or allow the protector to fall onto the phone.10) Once the home button is encircled, align one vertical edge of the protector (ok to do before removing the sticker completely)11) Use great care once the edge is aligned to hold the protector at the bottom edge, remove sticker #1 and only apply the protector to the very edge of one vertical side.12) use your fingers only, with a gentle bend in the screen protector to carefully lie upon the phone.With the absence of dust in the environment, there will be no bad bubbles. With a gentle bend in the protector there will be no bubbles as the protector is applied.-This product has a tactile resistance that is unlike my previous protector.I cannot attest to the durability of this product - Yet.I like them and have used a single protector from a pack of 3 for 2-3 months.At less than 50 each - there is NO reason to ever spend $14 for protectors from Apple. YOu are being completely robbed blind by suppliers who charge more than pennies for this product.I am very please with this product, would recommend and would buy again. Thanks Amazon.ps: even following my precautions, due to the sticker at the top causing a misalignment on the first try I somehow picked up a single teeny-tiny dust bit. The application was 99.999% perfect... and will do just fine because in a week or so it will be scratched up and you won't see this tiniest of particles when LCD is illuminated anyway. It would take an extremely discerning eye to locate the error... but there are two more should I care... and at pennies apiece I welcome a second try when I'm ready.--Update: It's April 2012 - This is the best screen protector I've used. The shiny surface seems extraordinarily scratch resistant. The one I applied when I wrote this review is still VERY nice. It's been long enough to change it, but I am convinced these are the best ones I've used... and MUCH better than the $14.95 version! I should order more before this store/supplier/supply disappears as they do. Thought it was worth coming back to report these are time-tested excellent.</text>

        <text>I bought this "leather" iPHone 5 case before I received the iPHone 5. The phone arrived before the case, so it took a long time coming. I know better than to order anything other than Amazon Prime, but this case LOOKED good from the "description".  NOWHERE on the box does it say the case is leather.  When I took it out, it was sticky and had the look and feel of plastic coated fabric.  It even has a fabric grain.  I also know better than to order from this seller, as I have had dismal experiences with ordering cases for other devices.  They arrive and don't fit right, but to return them you have to pay almost what they cost to purchase.  Not worth it all the way around.  This case WILL NOT protect my iPhone 5 from anything, let alone a fall; and the feel is downright off-putting.  It seems like a hastily made case to try to cash in on the iPhone 5 rush--but they couldn't even get it here on time with plenty of pre-order time.  DO NOT order this case if you are expecting leather; and no where in this world would it sell for the supposed retail of $49.95 immediately reduced to $9.95 before it ever came out.  It is an opportunistic way to cash in on the 5 needs without providing a quality or usable product, and severely misrepresenting this.  DO NOT BUY, unless you are willing to write it off when you don't like it, because return will cost--even on a defective and misrepresented product.</text>

        <text>Altec's BackBeat stereo headphones offers near-invisible stereo wireless headphones that can be paired with Bluetooth enabled devices, including A2DP-capable music players capable to streaming high-quality stereo output to Altec's Bluetooth-enabled headphones. This model does not include a Bluetooth transceiver to deliver A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) capabilities when connected to any player that has a standard 3.5 mm audio output jack. If such a device is needed to, for example, listen to Internet radio off a computer, then theAltec Lansing 906/R US BackBeat Headphone with Dongleis recommended.You get the following in the box:- Stereo headphones- with one pair of silicone ear buds (still trying to find a source for replacements)- Charger working through a USB Micro connection- English/Spanish manual, pretty good, actuallyMy review will first discuss features that I deem important then, I will close with a brief evaluation.Headphones:=========While not 'high end', they deliver a reasonably good quality sound. Some may have issues with headphones that go 'in' the ear rather than covering the ear. I know that I do but I seem to tolerate these quite well for as long as the volume is kept low.On the positive side, the 2 headphones are connected with a stereo cable that goes on the back of the head. This makes the entire assembly nearly invisible when worn, especially if the person who wears them has hair :). The microphone seems to be integrated in the headphones body and it seems to work well because no one asked me to speak louder while on the phone, using the BackBeat.The main concern is 'anatomy'. I have a big head and big ears and setting the earphones was not easy in the beginning even though the telescoping and swiveling adjustments do allow for some flexibility in wearing. I find that the more I get used to them, the easier it is to wear them. Again, a positive, once set, their extremely light weight makes for a very comfortable wear, so comfortable they almost 'disappear', unless they fall off.Pairing and maintaining connections:===========================- I had no problem pairing the headphones with a Blackberry and a Motorola Razor. It all works as the manual advises. When pairing the the phone, the headphones' password is always '0000' and it can't be changed.Controls:======It may take some getting used to but, here are the simple conventions:- Phone controls are mostly on the left-ear headphone- Music device controls are mostly on the right-year headphone- Rising tones usually mean that the feature is enabled/set/increased while falling tones mean the oppositeWhen connected to a phone you can answer the call, hang up, reject the call while listening to music, mute, raise/lower the volume, check the battery charge.For music features you can pause play, advance or go back one track (not tested by me yet), increase/decrease volume, enable/disable bass boost, pick up the phone or reject a call while listening. Play resumes after a call ends.It took very little time for the controls to become second nature.Performance and other characteristics:=============================A full charge completes in about 3 hours and little blue lights indicate the charge is full. Partial charging is possible in less than one hour. Claimed battery life on both devices is about 7 hours and my usage so far tends to confirm this.A carrying pouch is missing and it's missed. I would have felt much better if one was included because the headphones are small enough to be easily lost. I understand that the design was meant to allow carrying the headphones in a shirt pocket but I would have felt much more comfortable if I could store them somewhere other than a small pocket.__________________________________I hesitate between 4 and 5 stars. The more I use the BackBeat the more I enjoy using it. However, the missing carrying case - not easy to explain on a device within this price range and the lack of information on where or how to obtain spare ear buds call for a small deduction. With only a few small improvements, Altec could have a big winner in this product.The lack of a Bluetooth transceiver was not a factor when rating this product even though I WOULD recommend the higher end model which adds a lot more versatility for only a few dollars more.</text>

        <text>This is my 2nd attempt at bluetooth earphones for my Iphone 4s, purchased via another online retailer for $30.  I like the fact that these are buds and I don't have cans on my ears.  I'd like to listen to music while walking through airports without looking too much like a dork, and these fit the bill, although the design looks a bit like a hearing aid.Sound quality is fine, but the rubber ear piece doesn't fit entirely into your ear --  just a narrow tube points into your ear canal so the outside sound is not blocked and the volume is never too loud, even at the highest settings.  Personally, I wish the max volume was a bit louder, but the set is fine.Pairing was a breeze, and I can leave my iphone on the top floor and walk around the main floor of my house wearing the 903's without any loss of signal.  Really a nice feature!  Battery life so far has been solid, no worries there.  I like the fact that I can fast forward, rewind, and adjust the volume from the ear piece.  Also handles calls well, pauses the music, then re-starts after the call is completed.For me, I may still try the Ericsson IS800's and/or the LG Tone as both of those models have more traditional earbuds that look like they'll provide a richer sound while blocking out the world.So overall, sound gets a 4, features receive a 5, battery life a 5, range gets a 5, design gets a 3.  Depending on what's important to you, this may be a great option.</text>

        <text>I purchased this device and had it stolen on the first day of use.  I was so pleased with the Backbeat's comfort and sound quality that I decided to purchase another pair despite owning another set of Bluetooth headphones - the Jabra BT1101.  The 1101's Bluetooth connection was spotty at time for no reason and uncomfortable after 30 minutes of use.  The ear fit was loose so the sound wasn't as "filling" as in ear headphones.  The Backbeat 903/906 are a great step up from the adequate Jabra BT 1101 headphones.Edit:After owning if for several months, I found the build quality low and customer service lacking. I still like the form factor, but the headphones no longer charge and the stems leading to the earpieces are breaking apart.</text>

    <sentence id="8470">
        <text>Okay...so I read a gazillion reviews before purchasing these Bluetooth headphones.  I heard a lot of bad and I heard a lot of good.  Keep in mind that I have only had these for a day or so and will update if things change.Pros:I don't know what people are talking about...I have the iPhone 4 with the newest 4.1 update and the track foward/reverse buttons work great and the volume works great and ALL the buttons work with this headset. So the reviews that are saying some buttons don't work probably have a different phone than I do or older software.Also the design (for me) is SO comfortable! I have tiny ears so I was worried about the headset being too heavy for me.  It's not.  It is very lightweight and comfortable. I also LOVE the fact that the wire behind the head is sturdy enough that I'm not afraid I'll harm it if I tug too hard but flexible enough that I can lay in bed and watch movies or when I'm at the gym I can do my floor exercises without them pushing off my ears. The headphones even work with my Netflix on my phone so I can watch movies while I'm in class or at work! Totally awesome! Also, I like the in-the-ear feel better than on-the-ear.  So I enjoy having the headphones block out all the other sound.  I also like the open-mic feature so when I stop my music to talk to someone I can hear them clearly without them or me sounding muffled.I was able to walk through my whole house without losing connection and finally when I was at the other end and downstairs and there were walls between me and my phone that the phone finally beeped at me telling me it was losing connection.I like how since I'm a girl and have hair that you can barely tell that they are on my ears...they are not clunky and don't make me look like a techno-geek.Cons:They were a little hard to get on but that was fine with me since they were hard to get off also and I don't want them coming off since I am active.I wear glasses a lot of the time when I exercise and I had to put the headphones on FIRST and THEN the glasses.  Sometimes the glasses would push the headphones off my ears even though the they would stay in my ears and that was kind of annoying.  But it only happened about once every half hour or so.  I can live with that.I read a lot of reviews that said the battery acted up on these phones and the buttons stop working after a few weeks.  I've only had mine for a few days so I am keeping a watchful on those issues and will update later if I do have any.  I bought these from Wal-mart so hopefully they have a good return policy.  As for right now my little brother and husband have bought some too!  I am very satisfied:)</text>

        <text>I loved everything about this product, but it seems to be acting up with my iphone 4. A friends has blackberry phone, and doesn't have any problem with it. Please do more tests on this product with the iphone 4. I'm testing out another product, and will leave a feedback soon.</text>

        <text>I like this product very much for it's quality, performance and comfort for the price.  I use it in my home office to make calls and seldom have any problems (at least that aren't operator error!) I also use it for music and to listen to iPhone messages, books, videos, and other sounds without imposing my sounds on those around me.  After several months of heavy use I did have a plastic piece for the left button break which was likely more my fault than the device.  I contacted Plantronics' Quick Web service and they 2nd day FedEx'ed a warranty replacement with no further questions.  My only cost is to ship back the broken one.  Quick and simple process.Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the silicon ear pieces do not fit quite as well as I would like and tend to slip out if active when using them requiring reinserting them too often.  Providing options for different size ears would make this a five star product.</text>

        <text>I was given this headset to use during my workouts. After less than a month, it's started malfunctioning. It will randomly (and repeatedly) activate phone functions such as redial or voice control. When this happens, it becomes impossible to turn the headset off. Eventually it goes back to normal, but then it just starts malfunctioning again. Seems it can't handle a little sweat, which seems odd for a device that is made for sporty use.</text>

    <sentence id="8475">
        <text>I bought the 906 version which is identical to the 903, but adds a bluetooth transmitter dongle for non-bluetooth devices.This is my 4th Plantronics bluetooth device and the 2nd that has been stereo BT. I will be taking this back after a day of use for these reasons:1) These are uncomfortable. I hate ear phones and love earbuds(or canal phones or In-Ear-Monitors). These seem to be somewhere in-between. After about 30 minutes my ears hurt. Granted, I've been using Sony earbuds for the last 8 years, so that's what I am comparing them to. I can wear my buds for 8+ hours with no discomfort, I've been wearing the Backbeats for 3.5 hours today and they've been uncomfortable throughout. You only get one size and I'd say I have average to small ear canals.2) These only sound alright. Again I'm coming from 8 years of the same $60 earbuds from Sony. These have a lot more treble and sound tinny to me. I had a much better experience with the older Plantronics 855 stereo bluetooth which used earbuds similar to the Sonys. I like more defined bass that gives rock and alternative music a punch. The Backbeats make music I am familiar with sound much less dynamic. I had to use the bass boost option on all music. I think most people will be fine with the sound, but more discerning listeners should look elsewhere. There is a feature called OpenMic which is supposed to allow you to hear the outside world better when you press a button. I had no problems hearing around me with this option turned on or off, one of the 2 settings just adds a low static hum.3) I made one phone call for 30 minutes while driving in my car with the windows up and after 5 minutes my friend told me to take them back because I was difficult to understand and my voice sounded "hollow". They were functional, but not transparent. On my end, I had no problems understanding my friend so no complaints receiving.On a positive note, all of the buttons on the Backbeat worked as expected with my HTC Incredible. I was able to pause, back track and forward track songs, adjust volume. Pairing was easy. I use Meridian music player on my Incredible and the Backbeat controls it well. If you go into the Meridian player's preferences you can turn off the headset controls and that will allow you to control Pandora, Last FM and Slacker. Slacker sounded terrible - it seemed to have a dramatic lack of bass which I've read is a known problem with Slacker when not using Wi-Fi.Battery life seems great. I've been listening to music and made 40 minutes of phone calls for the last 4 hours and the Backbeat battery indicator shows that it is still 1/3 to 2/3's full. I'm not willing to use these any longer due to ear discomfort.The over the ear design wasn't too bad when I had my thick Arnette sunglasses on. But add a baseball cap on top and you've got a problem. The cord behind the neck is solid, but as others have noted, if you want to lay with the back of your head against a pillow or headrest, it will significantly apply pressure to your ears and this really highlights how uncomfortable the Backbeat is to wear.The separate dongle that you get with the 906 model worked as expected. I had to go through the pairing process each time I switched between my Incredible and the dongle. I'm not sure if there is a better way, but it didn't seem automatic after the initial pairings.Bottom line, don't bother trying these out unless you can take them back for a full refund. They look good on, but if they don't fit you just right, I think you are going to be disappointed. I've also read that there may be some huge reliability issues with the Backbeat and they do not seem to hold up to sweat so you should probably avoid these at all costs.</text>

        <text>I've owned the product for 3 years.  I bought it and a Plantronics Voyager Pro at the same time.  The Plantronics Voyager Pro failed 1 year and 1 month later.  The folks at Plantronics basically said "tough, would you like to buy our latest model?"  They had no interest in the fact that I was dissatisfied, and had contacted them several times about the call clarity of the unit.  (They blamed it on my iPhone, even after I exchanged the phone for another one to resolve the issue.  Then they said it was an iOS issue that would be taken care of in an upgrade.  Then later said, too bad, your exchange time is up, live with it and hope "Apple" fixes the issue.  Turned out it wasn't an "Apple" issue.)  Since everyone I talked to regularly was complaining about the call clarity on their end of the call when I used the Voyager Pro, I decided to look on it as a chance to replace it with something from a different company.  (They also complained when I called from the airport on the Plantronics BackBeat 903, but I used it so seldom for a call it wasn't important, the stereo sound, without tangling wires, was nice on the plane and in the airport.)The Plantronics 903 BackBeat, purchased at the same time as the Voyager Pro, was purchased solely to use on airplane trips.  It has only about 80 hours of total use, and looks brand new...including "standby" time, it has only been turned on about 81-82 total hours in the last 3 years.  It has been stored in a special travel case...which I purchased for it, in my dresser drawer with some clothing.  I got it out yesterday to check it for pairing with my phone for a trip I intend to take next month.  It did exactly the same as the Voyager Pro when it died; worked for a few minutes, fluttered, quit, and refused to re-charge or turn back on.  I had bought Plantronics products because I have an 8 year old Plantronics bluetooth headset (that I still use as a backup)....it still works fine and nobody complains about the call clarity when I need to use it.  The quality of their older models was excellent, both in use and longevity...you really got your money's worth from their earlier products.  (I bought a Jawbone Era to replace the Voyager Pro, and everyone has always been very happy with the call clarity...it is two years old now, so I recently bought a Bose bluetooth headset, and again...everyone is happy with the call clarity.)My point being, that something seems to have happened with Plantroics manufacturing quality a few years ago.  Their older bluetooth headsets were well made, reliable, had good range, good battery time, and the call clarity was wonderful.  The products I bought 3 years ago, including the Plantronics 903 BackBeat just turned out to be a big waste of money.  Unless Plantronics has revisited their "roots" and begun making quality products again, knowing what I do now, I certainly wouldn't consider this headset.  The 903 BackBeat would not have held up to someone using it for jogging or exercise...it didn't hold up, even for occasional use while traveling on an airplane.  Anyone considering this headset should take a look at other products.  I'm not sure Plantronic's newer stereo headset model is better, but I don't think I will risk it.I'll either used a wired headset when listening to stereo music, or enjoy the sound in only one ear from the new Bose headset I bought....it really is fantastic how rich the Bose sound is when playing music...even though it is only in one ear.  I really hope they come out with a stereo bluetooth dual ear model.  After my past experience with Plantronics poor customer service, I'm sure a call to them about a hardly used, 3 year old, 903 BackBeat would be another futile waste of time.  I really don't expect my electronics to last more than a couple of years with constant use.  But, anyone should expect more than around 80 hours of use time from a product they spend, $99.99 for....the price was still on the box from the "Apple Store.")  If I decide to buy another bluetooth stereo headset, it will be some brand other than Plantronics.  I'm glad I read the reviews and didn't buy their latest single ear headset when I bought the Bose instead last month.  Stick with Jawbone and Bose, you will be happy.</text>

        <text>I bought this headset to replace my beloved BlueFox 401s.  I like to listen to audiobooks during my long commute.  If I have a lot of telephone calls, a full charge is not enough to last all the way home in the evening.  The issue with the BlueFox is that there is no iGO tip available, so I can't charge them at work unless I carry around the wall charger.  The BackBeats charge with a standard micro USB tip (A97).  They fit on my head much the same as the 401s except that the flexible ear pieces fit a little more comfortably. The controls work very well with my Droid Eris, while only some of the 401 controls worked properly.  I love the behind-the-head style headset because my hair hides the headset so nobody can see it.  The behind-the-head part on the BackBeat is flexible.This headset is multi-point, you can pair to more than one device at a time.If you are trying to decide between the BackBeat 903 and the 906, the only difference is that the 906 comes with a bluetooth adapter for devices that don't support bluetooth.  If you are using a mobile phone the 903 will work.UPDATE August 18, 2011:  Although I really liked this headset, after less than a year of use it stopped working.  The volume suddenly dropped so low that I couldn't hear.  It happened while I was listening to a recorded book from my iPad.  No amount of messing around with the controls or resetting helped.  I ordered the Motorola S10 as a replacement.  I dropped my review to 2 stars because I think a headset should last longer, especially since I was not a heavy user - only one or two days a week.</text>

        <text>I had it for about 2 weeks.  The Altec Lansing Backbeat sound quality was good when it came to music. However, sometimes when I was receiving calls the caller couldn't hear me &amp; vice versa.  When the call did work and came through the caller complained of excessive background noise.  But the main problem I had was the fact it didn't want to stay snugly on my head...in my ears. I am a female with, what I'd like to believe, an average size head, but at times one side would come out of 1 ear and I'd have the worse time trying to get it coiled back around my ear to stay.  While finally getting the one side fixed, the other would come off.  Very annoying. It could have just been me, but it shouldn't be that difficult.Over all, it connected to my phone (EnV Touch) very easily &amp; kept the connection in spite of where I was at or what I was doing.  I returned it and will be trying the Motorola MotoROKR S9-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headset.</text>

        <text>I got it even for less than the price above (fourty)and i wouldn't give it more than 3 stars. Yet, it was still really good that i got a second one later on! The sound is really great, the fit is good and i have average ears, stays still while walking or running. The wireless experience with really good sound was, and still is, amazing for me, i even bought a bluetooth adapter for my ipod so i wont use all my phone's battery. BUT,this headphone has other bad sides that u need to consider, if u can live with them..like i did..u got urself a gr8 deal!First that wire at the back of ur head won't allow u to wear this with high collar clothes!it is flexible yet still longer than it should be, my neck is smaller than average so this may be the reason, in all cases they should have made it adjustable, coz it will annoy you while sitting or laying on ur back.. I have two of these, one refurbished &amp; one new.. Like many reviewers here, the refurb. had many connection problems..some may think the headphone broke, but it didn't! I was about to return it but decided to call Plantronics first to ask about it..it turned out to be just that it needed a reset ( never happened to the new one yet though, its connection is smooth &amp; easy!) To reset it, u have to hold the power key while plugging the charger in, the light will turn on and u can connect it normally to ur phone afterward! just make sure u turn off the headphone first before unpairing...for all this hassle it takes 3 stars(yeah not 2 nor 1) if the connection issue is solved and the back wire became adjustable this babe could easily get a 5 out of 5.*edit* The refurb one probably didn't have a very powerful connection, but this helped when there was many bluetooth devices in the area..! I found that the new one tends to be a little bit more intermittent &amp; the music breaks more often due to the very strong connection that keep looking for bluetooth devices even when paired and the music is on! However if u are in a big gym, where people aren't working out all the time around u it won't be a very big deal..</text>

        <text>I'm so mad I can't see straight!!  So keep that in mind as you read this review.  Because I won't bother repeating all the praises the 1 star reviewers have given it.  It's all true.  They're usually awesome.  Sound quality is great, battery life is long - and it doesn't take long to charge them up.But with that said - there is one thing that is so HUGELY ANNOYING it prompted me to write this review - so I could vent.  When the battery gets low - this ANNOYINGLY LOUD VOICE comes on saying "BATTERY IS LOW"!  And they've designed is to the volume of whatever you're listening to is cut to about 20% and the volume of this announcement is 80%.  SO ANNOYING I can't even tell you!You're on the phone, you have 2 hours of charge left - and this stupid announcement starts going off every couple of minutes.  Every time it goes off - you can't hear a word the person you're talking to is saying.So let's say you're doing a job interview or talking to a prospective client over the phone.  This person starts telling you what they're looking for and you really want to hear this because it has everything to do with whether or not you'll get the job.  And right when they get to the most critical thing - suddenly their voice volume is cut to 20% and all you hear blaring over their voice is - "BATTERY CHARGE IS LOW!!!"It'll drive you nuts!The sad thing is - this is a huge flaw on an otherwise perfect pair of headphones.  And the sadder thing is - it's completely unnecessary.  There are so many other ways for them to indicate to you that the battery is low - non-intrusive ways.  Like they could have a low-volume beep.  Or they could have the voice say "LOW BATTERY" instead of "BATTERY IS LOW".  It saves one word and can be said quicker.  And they could have it so this announcement uses 20% of the volume while allow whatever you're listening to take up 80%.Anyway, I just had to post something about this because I was SCREAMING at my headphones a few minutes ago!  It just amazes me how giant companies that only hire the smartest people in the world can do such dumb idiotic things.UPDATE 1/21/2014:  I just got a new pair of these because the battery on the old pair pretty much died.  (It lasted about 7 months).  This new pair is much better on the low battery announcements.  Much less intrusive.</text>

        <text>Bluetooth headphones are one of those things that once you get used to, you can't live without. In car they are especially useful, and then while exercising or going about the house and being able to use phone or MP3 player. The advantage of stereo Bluetooth headphones is that you can use them for music and phone both, not to say the good sound quality. After usingPlantronics Pulsar 590 590A Ultimate Stereo Sound Innovation Bluetooth Headsetfor almost 4 years I wanted something low profile that is easy to use while exercising. Here is what I found about these BackBeat headphones.PROS1. Low profile and and nice design.2. The accompanying users guide does not really explain how to place these headsets. But they just sit over the ears, outside the canal, and you do not insert the silicone ear buds inside the ear. Once you place them, these are very comfortable in upright position. But finding the right location for ear buds takes some time and fiddling around in both axes, verical as well as rotation. It took me a while to find that and I wish company had explained in literature or had a video demo on their web site.3. Easy to pair.4. Good, clear voice quality and noise suppression.5. Good quality music sound in entire frequency range.6. Ubiquitous Micro-usb charger.7.. Pleasant audible tones let you know when there is a new call or when the unit is turned on and off.CONS1. Bluetooth connection keeps disconnecting. For example you use in one phone call and and for the next call the headphones are not working.  For me, this was the biggest drawback which made me return these headphones.2. Although they say you can connect two devices simultaneously, in practice it does not work well. To give you the example, say you are listening music on iPod Touch, you get a phone call, and when you hang up the iPod Touch is disconnected.3. Short range, the sound quality drops after about 9-10 feet and Bluetooth disconnects after about 20 feet.4. Accidentally pressing the Call and Play/pause buttons while adjusting the headphones in ear is very easy and happens all the time. But volume button nicely placed and works well.5. Track forward and back does not work with iPod Touch.6. Microphone does not work on iPod Touch.7. Does not work for music on Palm Centro, only the phone part.8. On Macs, you pair it as headsets and it will work well for a while. Then mysteriously the Bluetooth audio profile changes to Headphones and Headsets and it will stop working in either profile. If you pair as Headphones, the microphone does not work.9. While it is comfortable in upright position, you cannot use in lying down position because the back cord is thick, moves, and the headphones come out off the ears. Same while exercising on treadmill, keeps coming off the ear.10. Poor battery life, about 4-5 hours use. You have to charge them for 3 hours to be able to use them for 4 hours!11. No indicator light to let you know when it is on. Blue lights comes on for a second when you first turn it on and then goes off.There are a lot of nice things about these headphones but they need to improve the software so it does not disconnect, thin the back connecting cord, explain how to place the headphones in or over the ear, and make that telescoping and rotating mechanism a little sturdy so it holds in the same position. Since thePlantronics Pulsar 590 590A Ultimate Stereo Sound Innovation Bluetooth Headsetrarely disconnected, the repeated disconnection was really the clincher for me, which made me return these headphones and replace them with New Samsung WEP870 Mono + Stereo BT Headset which I found on sale at Verizon Wireless web site, lot cheaper than here.</text>

        <text>Altec Lansing 903/R US BackBeat Headphone is a very good wireless headset, both for phone/talk and music. It is comfortable to wear and provide very decent sound quality (stereo).Pros:1. Very comfortable to wear (and light)2. Great overall sound quality (stereo)3. Bass is strong (with bass boost feature)4. Great battery life (6+ hours talk/music time)5. New OpenMic technology is very useful (so you don't have to take off the headset if you want to hear the surrounding)6. Quick switch from listening to music to picking up the phone7. Headset have dedicated button for remote control phone/music operation (like volume, bass, play, pause, switch to phone, mute, open mic control)Cons:1. Sound not as crisp as wired headphone (when listening to music), but very close, and for wireless, I think it's good enough2. Volume control is one level change per click (can't just hold the volume up or down to change the volume multiple level)3. Buttons are very small and it's not very easy/comfortable to press when you are wearing the headphone4. Have to press and hold the small button for 2 seconds to turn on or off (both headset and bluetooth adapter)5. It takes 3 hours to fully charge (1 hour charge will be nice)All in all, while this is not a perfect product, it is very good wireless product. And listening to music in wireless with a decent sound quality, priceless!If your music/mp3 players doesn't have bluetooth capability and you want to listen to it in wireless, you can check the Altec lansing 906/R BackBeat Headphones where a bluetooth adapter is included.Sidarta Tanu</text>

        <text>I was looking for a replacement for my Motorola blue tooth headphones that stopped working within 20 hours of use.  Motorola was not satisfied with my receipt and would not replace them, so I decided to look at other options.  I own a Plantronics blue tooth headset for use with my phone when I drive, and like their product AND service.The reason I wanted a blue tooth headset was for my workouts at the gym.  I really like the flexible wire that connects both sides together, unlike the Motorola set that had a rigid connection that also put the bulk of the unit behind your neck ... not good when doing exercises where you lie on your back.The unit connects to my iPhone simply by turning them on!  Press the button in the right ear piece and the music starts to play.  It's very easy.The only drawback I see is that they appear not to do well with sweat.  I had one side stop working, but after 24 hours they were back to normal.  I now swap to a normal wired set of earbuds when I do my cardio workout to keep the sweat out of these.  This is not a big deal as the wire does not get in the way during my cardio workout, only my weight lifting workout.Also, it takes a little practice getting these on your ears ... at least for me it did.</text>

        <text>Like several other reviewers, I've had the power button problem. I'm sending back my second set as I write this,but I still want this headset because I don't think there is anything better that has the same features (luckily I have a backup headset to use during the BB903 downtime). The user controls are excellent. The microphone performance is better than any other bt 'stereo' headset I've used in noisy environments (I've used in the past sony ericson and itech), but the noise reduction still is not good enough to have a normal voice volume conversation when in a moderate street noise environment. This headset is great for stereo listening in background noise levels up to a moderate street noise environment. The user controls permit the user to easily control the headset with minimal distraction and time. Transitioning from headset listening, to a face-to-face conversation (where you can clearly hear every word they are speaking) with someone is simple, and takes a fraction of a second to touch the headset controls. They are great to wear while driving if one is expecting a phone call during driving. Wind noise isolation is ok in winds up to about 15 mph.</text>

        <text>This pouch is almose perfect for an Iphone 4 (with Bumper).The construction is very nice. Appears to be real leather.  The coloring is very nice and the workmanship is very nice too.These are made in sweden and maybe that's part of the details that are frustrating.  The vendor went and put a big metal Krusell plate in front of the case.  Clearly visible in the pictures but there appears to be a backing to that metal plate in the back that is only covered by the single layer "sand" liner.  Why?????  I can see how over the years that's going to be an issue (the inside leather liner will probably tear exposing the metal backing - argh).  Also, if you put your thumb on the metal plate and squeeze you can tell that you're transmitting pressure energy to the screen of your iphone.  very suboptimal and really detracts from the protective features of this case is intended for.  I really wish the vendor had not decided to slap their big metal logo plate right in the middle of the case (which winds up resting on the screen).  It detracts from the protection this case is supposed to offer.  So yes, I've flipped my phone and put it in backside up into the case - so that the hard metal logo plate can't press against my screen. Still...The second wierd thing is a small metal loop ring in the back.  It comes with a round carabiner style ring.  I have no idea what I'd use that for.  My iphone 4 fits nice and snug but nowhere near snug enough that I'd put this case on some kind of carabiner or keyring - odd.  It would be much cleaner without.Overall, if you have a bluetooth headset and you don't have to look at your phone all the time, this is a nearly perfect case.Putting in and removing my Iphone 4 is not too hard but it is snug -- I do have an Apple bumper on my phone though and I know it would fit a bit looser if I didn't have the bumper but alas, I like the bumper and the case.Aside from those two things mentioned above, this case is fantastic!I went ahead and got theKrusell 95294 Gaia Universal Slim Leather Pouch Large for iPhone 4, Verizon iPhone 4, iPhone 3G/3G S, Samsung Galaxy S, T-Mobile G2, HTC Droid Eris and other Mobile Phones (Black)which doesn't suffer from the two issues  mentioned above with the Luna.

Another is the fact that there is no protection for the top, so try not to drop it upside down.

        <text>I had been using pocket pouches with BlackBerry devices for years. When I bought the Note 2, I wanted the same kind of pouch. The Krusell is by far as close as I'm going to get, and it's even better aesthetically, given the beautiful supple leather.That suppleness, while pleasing to the hand and eye, keeps it from being a five-star item, however. The case lacks the stiffness that would afford better protection (and also lacks cardboard between the leather and the inner liner that would afford much the same protection). It lays completely flat, unlike leather pocket pouches that generally retain the shape of the device.  Also, the suppleness creates an ever so slight tendency for the two halves of the upper opening to curl up.Like most good pocket pouches, it has cut outs on the top left and right to allow you to pull the device out by its sides.  However, the Note 2's sides are fairly slippery, which makes it difficult to pull out of the pouch at times. Obviously, this is not the pouch's fault, but it's something to be aware of. Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this if you are in the market for a pocket pouch for your Note 2.</text>

        <text>I hang it towards the front and clip it on my belt pant loop and its always in a good spot, I don't like to hang it from the side because I just think it would be more exposed to hitting something but the length is PERFECT.

        <text>I would rate this a 5 star product except for the heat that it retains from the phone.

        <text>Cell phone accessories vary tremendously in price for products that are pretty much the same.  This charger works with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and charges the phone while I drive, which is all I ask of it. A little red light goes on when the unit is pushed far enough into the cigarette lighter to allow it to charge, whether or not it's attached to a phone, so when it occasionally needs to be pushed a little further in, it's easy to notice this--the red light goes out--and you can push it back in snugly.  I have no reason to believe the unit is any more or less rugged than any other at any price, so for the very reasonable cost of this one, I think it's a great value.</text>

    <sentence id="8526">
        <text>Samsung put some thought into the design of its car battery charger.  Many poorly designed chargers overheat, and they can also cause the battery to overheat, which is the reason many batteries fail to properly hold a charge.Samsung designed this car charger to not activate until after the phone is attached, so you can keep the charger plugged in at all times without it getting hot.  A green light tells you when the phone is being charged.  The next "smart" design feature is that the charger provides a fairly rapid charge until the battery reaches about an 80% charge, and then it provides a slow "trickle" charge to slowly take the battery to 100%.  That prevents overheating the battery and shortening its life.However, because of that slow "trickle" charge feature, it is possible for the battery to actually LOSE some of its charge under high drain conditions.  For example, if you have a 95% charge, and are using 3G, GPS satellite location, and Google maps, your charge will slowly sink toward about 80%, as those features drain the battery rapidly.The battery charge is likely to stabilize in the 80% range, and will begin to go up when 3G, the GPS satellite locator, and Google Maps are turned off.  And use your task manager to make sure they are REALLY off, and not still running in the background, killing your battery).Some folks use their car charger for hours each day. A charger used 30 hours a week is going to fail a lot sooner than chargers used one or two hours a week.  At Amazon's low price, heavy users should consider buying a couple of the Samsung chargers, and keeping a spare on hand.</text>

It's distracting in its brightness.  It is SO bright, I've put a piece of masking tape over it.  Sounds pretty attractive, right?!?It is very hard to plug it into my vehicle's outlet--I have to really shove it and both the charger and the outlet bend in the struggle.

        <text>For basic phone charging in your car, there's nothing wrong with this Samsung charger and it gets extra points on Amazon for being 75% cheaper than so-called "Best Buy".

        <text>I bought this to charge a Samsung Infuse 4G while in the car and it works fine.  It seems to supply a higher current than the generic (retractable) charger I bought for my other vehicle.  The charge is acceptably quick and both ends of the charger seem to have quality connectors.  There is a slight jiggle to the USB connector end while attached to my phone, though I'm not sure if this is a fault of the charger or the phone.I would recommend keeping this in a secure location with no undue pressure on the plug.  This could fatigue the connector and cause failure over time.  I mention this because the coiled cord is fairly short by default.  It obviously stretches out, but since the coil is so strong you really have to pull it to increase the length.  The amount of force that it takes to stretch the thing out is probably higher than you should be putting on the USB connector, so use with caution.</text>

I don't know this will happen to most people as my daily usage is heavy.Slightly long, could be more flush mount style.I am only reviewing this item that I purchased 6 months ago because I came to buy another charger,  I will not buy this one again though, I will now go with a more flush mount and a higher rate of charge.

        <text>This is a generic 'Type A to Micro B' USB cable and it's in no way Blackberry specific but, YES, it WILL work with a BB Bold or Storm. I needed one of these to connect one camera to the computer because I lost the original when someone 'found' my camera case. It works.On this specific cable, everything is done right, including the price. It is USB 2.0 certified, meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps and, if your device accepts a Micro-B plug, this is the cable to get. Maybe the 2-meter length (6+ ft.) is a little bit too much but it does not bother me a lot and there may come a time when a cable this long may come in handy.I am awarding this item 5 stars for price, quality and, especially, for the very good presentation on Amazon's page.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop, the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need. This Amazon listing and most Cables Unlimited listings are most helpful because the Amazon page gives you a visual of what the connectors look like. Whenever in doubt, do some more research.</text>

        <text>Before anyone gets bent out of shape, I just want to say that I knew full well what I was getting myself into.  Namely, that some have used it for Blackberries.  That being said, I decided that a couple of bucks was nothing much to lose with my experiment.  On a Samsung Intercept, you'll notice that the micro usb area on the phone is covered by what seems like a flimsy tied on piece of rubber that folds down flat when not using the plug.  When you try to push the micro usb charger or sync plug into the phone, it is a very tight fit and really can't be done (by me) in full dark.  I always have to use a separate light source to accomplish my goal, but I risk waking up my hubby when I do that.  Also, it has a short cord, which is great if you don't need a long one.  I've also gotta say that the cable is really thick so it isn't forgiving and doesn't want to lay flat.Despite all that, I do recommend it to anyone that doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg for these. They do the job.</text>

        <text>I never thought I'd write a review for a USB cable, until a no-name 99 white cable I was using burned up on me in my car while charging myJabra SP700 Bluetooth Speakerphonevia thePowerjolt Dual Universal USB Micro ChargerI have plugged into my center console's 12V power jack.I don't know what the current demand was of the speakerphone battery, nor do I know what max amperage of the cheap white cable was rated at versus this BlackBerry cable, but this cable is definitely thicker and hopefully won't suffer a similar demise. The Powerjolt charger puts out a claimed 1A per port, which is quite a healthy amount of juice for your typical itty bitty USB cables.The micro USB end of the cable isn't too fat to prevent it from connecting with the Jabra nor myPlantronics Savor M1100 Bluetooth Headset(some bulkier USB ends had interference problems with plugging in to the Jabra charging port.My one criticism of this cable is that there's nothing molded into the plugs or stenciled on the cable to indicate that it is in fact a genuine RIM / BlackBerry product.

        <text>Received the cable today from my personal favorite Amazon cell phone accessory dealer, Elctromaster.  I tried it out immediately by plugging it into the USB port on my PC at my desk at work, then into my BlackBerry Style 9670.  The USB Port/PC instantly recognized the phone as a "BlackBerry Device" and began charging it, same as my OEM cable.  I'm not going to use it as a data sync cable, but only as a back-up charger, and it works perfectly so far.  It's a bit of a thinner gauge compared to the original OEM cable that came with my phone, but at the same time is much more flexible and pliable.  It is NOT BlackBerry branded (but wasn't expected to be based on the description), and is quite a bit shorter than described.  Amazon states 3.9 feet.  I don't have a tape measure with me, but placed side by side with the OEM cable, it's about 18 inches shorter.  No problem for me.  That actually works out better because I only need maybe 2 feet to charge my phone at work.  If you're looking for a longer cable, you might want to look into a different one though.  Other than the length, it's as described, in NEW condition, and works as expected.  5 stars from me.</text>

        <text>I bought 2 of these for me and my wife, the price was just that good!Granted, the price is just too tempting, I don't like the sound quality; it's just too distorted/muted. When talking to someone, they need to concentrate when talking to me; things I say are not very crisp. It became apparent to me when talking to my wife, she has to clearly say everything so I can hear her.Today, I got frustrated and asked her to switch to her phone, the sound clarity amazing. This is the main reason why I'm returning the headsets.If you're looking for a cheap hands-free headset, this is for you. I'm looking for better sound quality though, so I'll be exchanging these two for something else (probably PlanTronics Voyager 510/520).</text>

        <text>This is one of the best bluetooth accessories you can have for any type of cell phone. Pretty comfortable to wear for a long period of time. It is mostly noise free in public use. This is actually one of the first ones that I have bought and still performs like a charm. Anyone that purchases this product wont be disappointed. Very pleased with the long life in between charges. It will only take most cell phones a few seconds to pair up with whatever phone you have that have bluetooth technology. I use it all the time and it is an exellent handsfree unit.

        <text>Our Motorola Bluetooth died after many years of use. Coincidentially this SAMSUNG WEP 460 was on sale and seemed a bargain but buyer beware, you get what you pay for.With the Motorola Bluetooth when you open the thing to attach it to your ear the unit turns on. When you remove it and close the ear thing it shuts off. This Samsung WEP460 has to be pushed to turn it on and off which is a pain in the neck to get used to and is an extra step. If you forget to shut it off after taking it off the power stays on and the battery will get drained.Worse is the fact that the charger it comes with is a standard AC adaptor for recharging inside your home. The way the packaging is, the charger is hidden inside a plastic bubble container and hidden behind black paper. You have to look very closely at the back of the packaging where an image that is 1 millimeter is shown -- look closely at that fine line drawing and that is how you will know the charger inside is AC for indoor use.We had been in the routine of using the Bluetooth when driving the car and charging it in the car and just leaving both the Bluetooth and its charger in the car all the time. We don't presently own a cigarette lighter car recharger that fits the SAMSUNG WEP460 so that would be another purchase for us (therefore raising the price of the cost of owning this unit vs the Motorola Bluetooth). Today I see the compatible cigarette lighter car charger sells for MSRP $45 which is more expensive than this SAMSUNG WEP460 Bluetooth unit itself which seems crazy!The sound quality is just fine.We regret this purchase. Next time we'll buy the Motorola Bluetooth.We also learned a lesson that the cost of these accessories is not just the accessory but the charger units. When replacing existing accessories you can save money by purchasing accessories compatible with the charging units you already own.</text>

    <sentence id="8691">
        <text>I've had a number of bluetooths before. A couple of Motorolas (which I love), an Emerson, etc. This one has great sound quality. The volume is pretty low when you first put it on, but after turning up the volume it works great. The buttons are easy to press and it answers without any issues and seems fairly reliable. It comes with two ear hooks, but not two different sizes. It's strictly a replacement if one gets broken or lost. It also comes with several speaker covers, so that it will fit inside your ear better. It's too bad then that the ear hooks don't come in sizes. Also there are no instructions at all on replacing the hooks nor the covers.My problem is that it refuses to stay on my ear and rubbed a sore right onto my ear. I tried switching all the speaker covers, but that doesn't have anything to do with the ear hook. Also, because there is no wire in the hook, you cannot bend it to fit your ear properly. That is a definite design flaw. I have tiny ears compared to the average person. This bluetooth assumes that there is a lot of space between the side of my head and the edge of my ear. That is not the case at all with my ears. This is why a curve is important for me, but there is none and no way to make one.In fact, if you look carefully for a side view of this bluetooth, you'll see that there is no curve whatsoever for the ear hook. It is commonly known that all should have a slant. I guess you get what you pay for. I never had this issue with my higher grade models. The ear hooks were both comfortable and reliable. This one makes my ear bleed and will not stay on. It's not how I put it on, my daughter (who works at Radio Shack) even tried to help me, but without success.If I could replace the ear hook, then it would be a top-notch bluetooth, but that is impossible so it gets a lower rating. Sorry Samsung!</text>

        <text>I bought this to replace my 5 year old Plantronics. Which still worked great but the flexible earpiece was finally beyond my tweakability.With pretty decent reviews - and a sale price trying to be frugal - I got what I paid for.Binding issues. This puppy doesn't stay connected well to my HTC Incredible. Anytime It gets somewhat separated I have to push the connect/device button on the android to get it to reconnect. It's very frustrating and my Plantroncs was awesome about staying connected / re-connecting.Volume doesn't go up quite enough. I drive a Toyota Tundra and a Honda Odyssey which are both pretty quiet (both loaded vehicles) with a little truck road noise (tires) or kids. And it's barely loud enough if there's no other traffic and/or kids are quiet.Noisy to callees . People I call always complain about having difficulty understanding me so it doesn't do a good job of cancelling ambient noise.For both Noise and Volume reasons I end up driving with my left hand cupped over my ear and towards my mouth. Hands free? Not longer!Battery charge life is also poor. So unless I keep it plugged in (problematic with the AC only adapter and a pita) I never know if it's just failed to re-connect -- or is dead again.No more inexpensive / mid / low end headsets. You get what you pay for. Be sure to look for good reviews on noise cancelling, power, binding. And compare against more expensive models - as that's where you usually get references to "this replaced my crappy xyz" which you may otherwise find got good reviews from people that got lucky or didn't know better etc.</text>

It's always there for a "grab and go" besides.It's attractive, takes up little space, and all in all, is a nice value and all around practical item.Yes, you have to take your phone out of whatever case it might be in to insert it.

        <text>This is an excellent product which enables you to have your Blackberry on your desk or bedside table, charging up with the clock-face visible. It's small and neat, and simplicity itself to use. It's more convenient than just using the mains charger (which BTW you'll need to buy separately). It's also very cheap for a genuine Blackberry accessory.The only minor drawback, pointed out by some other reviewers, is that there is no charging/now fully charged indicator on the device: you'll know the phone is actively charging when the clock-face is visible, but will need to look at the phone battery power indicator to know when it is fully charged.Overall, recommended for convenience.</text>

        <text>The skin can be a very welcome accessory for those who keep their Blackberries mostly on their desks or maybe in their pockets.Tt does 'fit like a glove' or, better, like a second skin. The skin feels very good to the touch - it almost sticks to your grip when you hold the Blackberry in your hand - and it's perfectly cut to allow for the various ports and buttons to be accessed.The main and only inconvenience with this potentially useful add-on is that it makes it difficult to take the Blackberry in and out of the holster because it makes it thicker and because the skin tends to stick to the holster's own protective walls and I have to apply some extra force to pull it out. Since the default place for my Blackberry is IN the holster, this is important to me.After a couple of months I finally removed the skin.</text>

        <text>The vendor picture on the product page is NOT of the product shipped, at least to me (twice). I have added a photo on the product page showing the 30-pin end of what I actually received.The vendor erroneously limits this product to the iPhone 3G and a gaggle of iPods, not understanding that all of the iPhones (so far) use exactly the same USB cable configuration -- if it works with one, it will work with all. USB only has 4 wires, and a USB cable's job is just to get them from one end to the other in the right order. Not a lot of room for specialization.There is no requirement for any other special pin setup on the Apple 30 pin connector for a simple USB cable. Docks can have issues, but USB is USB is USB.After a hiccup with a faulty first sample, (resolved satisfactorily by the vendor)  I now have one that works, and works perfectly with the iPhone 4.Note that the body on this 30 pin connector is rather large -- the largest I have seen. It is almost exactly twice the length of the Apple issue connector and most of the white aftermarket clones of it. I can't think of any good reason for (or advantage to) the huge connector body, and it does potentially increase the leverage on the iPhone/iPod connector.On the other hand, this cable is substantially longer than most -- at least 18" longer than any of the other USB-&gt;iPhone cables I have. This can either be a clutter issue, or a wonderful feature.I like it.The length allows me to easily use the iPhone while it is connected to a USB charger plugged into a floor-level power strip, while the general run of cables barely make it to the chair arm.In the car, it is long enough to stash the iPhone on the dash while it is plugged into a charger port near floor level -- not possible with the shorter "standard" cables.So if you want a longer cable and/or one that isn't soon-to-be-grimy white, and don't want to spend a lot of bucks on it, you might want to give this one a try.</text>

        <text>i bought these as a replacement for the screen protector i purchased when i got the phone.  my old one had been beaten up and had a few nicks in it (after a year and a half).  i put one of these on a few months back and it's already pretty beat up.  it works but isn't great quality.  i would recommend getting some at at&amp;t or sprint for a few more bucks.  if you don't mind changing the cover ever few months, these are a good cheap option.</text>

    <sentence id="8744">
        <text>This is a great product at a fair price.  I hope it is useful to note: this is my third purchase of this particular product and I plan to order from this company in the future.  The most important feature of a screen protector is PRIVACY: when I am working, texting or just idling in public places, I want my all of my information protected.  This product accomplishes the task beautifully!  The screens are easy to install and fit perfectly on my iPhone 3G.  I find the mirror finish stylish and useful; I can even check my lipstick...ha ha! The only negative is the screen gets smeared and dirty very easily; however, the product does include a lint cloth. The glue on the back of the screen protector adheres to the iPhone very well and the bubbles that appear upon install can be completely smoothed and eradicated. The screen protectors are durable and one can last for several months.  I like to change screens every month or so and at this price, I can do it!  Good job, Empire; thank you!</text>

        <text>The screen protector was ok. It protected the screen perfectly, as it should, but it  got scratched pretty easily.

        <text>These are really inexpensive screen protectors that look a little bit better in the photos than in real life.Pros:Protector is slightly thicker than the protector that came with my 3G.It is easy to fit over your screen for application if you go slowly.The mirror effect is cool in itself.Very easy to apply without bubbles forming.It is very inexpensive.Cons:The mirror effect is not like a mirror but more of a flat silvery color.The cover shows minor scratches very easily.Bubbles can be taken out with a credit card, but minor scratches occur.Unlike a clear screen cover, this one has a fine grid, but you can easily see past it.Brightness (outdoors) makes reading a little difficult.For the price and for what you get, it is a deal.  It is simply a matter of what you want your iPhone to look like.</text>

        <text>I received the order in short time.  Each screen protector is packed separately with its own lint cloth, which I did not expect at this low price level I saw similar protectors for sale at the cell phone store for $30! It's amazing how much Amazon saves you.As expected, it transforms my iPhone 3G to a big mirror when not in use. This helped avoid confusing my iPhone with my wife's! When you use the iPhone, it lights up and you'd be able to see the screen. Here are the drawbacks:1) The holes for the speaker and home buttons did not come off easily. The instructions did not specifify whether you should leave them on.  But it did not seem like a good idea to leave the speaker covered, so we used a key to push these pieces out.2) As people have mentioned, it's very hard to see the iPod screen outdoors in bright sunlight with this on. Some suggested turning the brightness up, which might help but will drain your battery quicker.3) There is a visible rainbow effect which might bother some people while others might find it cool!</text>

I did not have trouble putting the screen protector on; I got it straight, with no air bubbles the first time round so I guess I can say applying it was easy for me I had no problem with it. It does come with a cleaning cloth that is kinda cheap but I have plenty of those anyway so I'm not complaining.Pros: -CHEAP!!-Actually good quality-Free shipping-Package has 5 screen protectors plus a cleaning cloth-I found it super easy to put mine on my iphones screen, and I got it perfect the first timeCons:Since shipping is free it took them just under a month to get here lol apparently they come from hong kongI would definitely buy these again...

        <text>I am coming from using those 20 dollar Invisible Shields from Zagg. After the 1st one got ruined (within 3 months) I refused to spend another 20 bucks for another. This deal is amazing. It even looks clearer and is smoother than the Zagg shields. The price is is where this product shines.Just be sure of 2 things during application. NO DUST on surface (I used the sticky part of the 1st shield I miss used as a sticky dust magnet to prep the surface for 2nd try.. worked perfect. The other tip is make sure you lay it down perfect (not laying on edge of the chrome frame of the phone. If you do it will leave bubbles on the edge.. this is why I retried a 2nd time I was "slightly" off perfect and it left a lil bubble top right edge.Tip for application: Peel off layer marked "2" completely. Than peel only a tiny bit of layer "1" and get it lined up on the surface (down near home button on phone) make sure there is no bubbles. Then use a credit card to push up the phone... at the same time peel layer 1 off (same motion) If you had no dust on the surface and you are lined up perfect... you will see no bubbles and it will look flawless. Good luck!!!I use an Incase Slider case. The 1st time I didn't have the shield perfectly laid down the case made it worse and threw lots of bubbles along the edge. The 2nd time I got the shield perfect the case didn't even seem to touch it... ZERO bubbles. Its like nothing is on the phone at all.I came back here mostly to buy 2 more packs for the future. 20 times cheaper than zagg invisible shield (I feel like i saved tons of cash doing this)</text>

    <sentence id="8805">
        <text>There's a reason why this is so cheap - i should have guessed, but until i find a better one, it will have to do. The seller is probably trying to get rid of inventory at a loss.- The size is off; it doesn't cover the glass entirely - it's too narrow and too long. When it comes to protectors, being off even a half a mm is a pain. That's why even if you know how to put these on, you're gonna go through a few to make the adjustment for wrong sizing. I went through two.- The plastic is super cheap so your fingers will not glide on it. Which means they get sticky, like if there's some kind of glue on it. That also means that you're not gonna be able to get all the bubbles out. I still have two small bubbles i can't push out from underneath.- And this is probably the biggest problem - the plastic film is so cheap that it has a rainbow effect; if you look at it from most angles, you will see the rainbow unevenness going across horizontally. It's like what you see when you mix water and gasoline. It's very annoying.Save yourself the trouble and disappointment - don't buy this product.</text>

        <text>Reviewing is my favorite part. The product came as described, with 5 screen protectors each individually packed in their own sleeve and 5 lint cleaning cloths, although I didn't bother with the cloths. I didn't even put the thing on my screen.I already have a screen protector, but I needed another one to cut up and put over the apple logo since it was exposed. I opted to buy the 5 screen protectors for $2 over the $20 shield. Truth be told, 1 of the protectors had a bubble in them so I used that one first. I did get one small piece of lint, but this was no problem as I just used a piece of tape to lift it up and another piece of tape to remove the lint. On another note, it didn't have any sticky residue people commented about.The part where all the negative reviewers fail is applying. Seriously, you need to look up videos on applying screen protectors. Don't watch just one, watch several. You have 5 protectors, at least practice with the first one.PATIENCE IS THE KEY!!I will be more than happy to use this when my screen protector needs to be replaced.</text>

The last protector was thicker and the cell case would snag causing the protector to come loose.You need to make sure the glass surface is completely clean before applying. I'd use a quality screen cleaner and compressed air can to clean. It helps to make notes about the areas that are having issues with the old protector and be sure to clean those areas very well.</text>

        <text>These work great and once applied, you can't even tell they are on the iPhone.  It was perfect size and shape.  The protector itself has a plastic shield on both sides that you peel off during installation.  I have found installation of any protective screen is tricky as you need to align it very carefully, paying close attention to the edges.  These come with a small lint-free cloth and I used some Windex before that.  I would recommend using the edge of credit card to push any air bubbles to the side and then you have it.  If by chance you get it on wrong, just try again or pitch it and install another as the main thing is to keep from permanently scratching the iPhone display with you keys, pocket change, pens or when you drop it on a hard surface.  Eventually the corners will get peeled up and that allows dirt underneath, so you'll replace it eventually ... that is why five in a pack is great.  I tried a more expensive brand from Apple but found this one worked just as well.</text>

        <text>There isn't a lot to say about these.  They work. You just have to make sure you put them on a very clean surface.  I put 3 of them on our phones and we still have the originals on almost 6 months later.  They work very well.</text>

        <text>I got these for my wife's iPhone 3G, and I have to say they weren't terrible but I have seen a lot better.

        <text>I got this pack of covers when i had my iphone 3gs. After a couple hours of use, you should not even notice that the thing is on there (assuming it has been installed correctly). With the 5 pack, you have a couple to practice your installation techniques with. If you are considering buying similar protectors for more money, please dont. they are all the same.Although the description says that these are reusable, it is hard to take one of them off, and put it back on without some lint getting stuck to it.

        <text>Really liked this product. I changed screen protectors twice I believe in a matter of nearly a year. I'm really good about cleaning the screen keeping things looking good. My concern was whether the screen protector would pick up scrathces when in my pocket and it passed that test each and every time. The first time I tried to use 1 of the screen protectors it picked up lint pretty quick even though I was installing in the bathroom which is usually a bit safer then a bedroom when lint is concerned.

It's got great touch sensitivity and fits perfectly.If you're super picky you may notice a weird "rainbow" effect, and I did notice it once, but I haven't seen it since and it may have gone away since being on my phone for a while now.I highly recommend this.</text>

        <text>I've used a few of these screen protectors and I love them. The great thing is that if you totally screw up one of them just toss it and use another. For less than $0.20 a piece you can afford to screw up a lot. I just don't get how some of these screen protectors can cost $5 a piece. Rip off!!!Air bubbles are pretty easy to deal with. A credit card works great to work those out. The worst thing is getting dust on these and I don't know what to tell you about that. The only thing you can do is get the cover on the phone as quick as possible but even then avoiding dust is very hard. Pulling off the protective plastic when installing creates static which attracts any piece of dust within a 10 foot radius. So it's a bit of a conundrum.Regardless, these work great for me. You can buy and screw up a lot of these before you make up the cost of a new front glass on your phone.</text>

        <text>These screen protectors came as part of a combo purchase recommended by Amazon.  I ordered a charge/sync cord and wall charger for my iPhone and the best price available included these screen protectors.  I needed to replace the one on my phone as it had a scratch, nothing minor so I had been putting it off. When these arrived I pulled off my old protector, cleaned the screen on my phone very carefully and started to put on the first one. It apparently came with dust already attached to the sticky side so I ended up with a small bubble under the protector.  I also noticed that it had a very noticeable kind of swirly rainbow look to it under the lights in my office. I decided that since I got five of these I would try again.  I managed to get it on a bit crooked on my first try and discovered the rainbow effect again.  Since I had three left I decided to give it one last try.  I got it on straight this time but once again ended up with a piece of dust on the underside of the protector and the rainbow effect was still there.Don't waste your money on these.  I threw the last two away.</text>

        <text>I bought iPhone 3GS for my family member few weeks back and to protect the screen I decided to buy a cheap and good screen protector. I read some nice reviews about this product and decided to give a try for $1.00. They delivered 5 pack of screen protector (Good thing) but unfortunately none of them worked so well. All my 5 front side screen protector are went bad. Some of them gave me bubbles, some came off right away after sticking on the screen for 3 minutes. Very cheap material. If you even try to put on screen protector very accurately by following their methods and procedures then also it will leave some bubbles. Putting on screen protector you will get some scratch. For me it was a bad purchase. I would definitely not going to recommend this to anyone. Pay little bit extra and get good quality and durable screen protector.</text>

        <text>This headset arrived promptly and looked to be in good shape. It paired easily with my LG Android phone (even tho I had never worked with a Bluetooth device before - it was easy!), and my older LG phone. It seemed to function well for the weekend that I used it. It didn't fit my ear very well, but I adjusted it until it was reasonably secure. The audio was fine, and the party on the receiving end said they could hear me distinctly, so I thought everything was going well. Then yesterday it stopped functioning totally! I couldn't turn it on, the only way I could get any life out of it was to plug it into the charger- the red "charging" light would come on, but then would go off after a short time. Let it stay on the charger awhile, then tried again. No go. No life. Dead. I can only assume it was an initial failure. I'm not going to fault Plantronics, because I've used their products before in an office environment and they were very dependable. However, this IS a discontinued model and if you want any replacement parts such as ear tips, etc., be prepared - I couldn't locate any parts for this model even from the Plantronics people. Probably a good deal if you just want a cheap throwaway headset to try that's easy to operate.</text>

        <text>This device did not perform at all as well as I expected from a Plantronics product. The range is very poor, and the noise level is completely unacceptable, even inside in quiet environments. Outside in even mildly breezy conditions it is unusable.

        <text>The range of this bluetooth is very poor. You can't walk more than 3ft away from it before it starts to sound flaky. The headset is comfortable and battery life is really good. Other problem I had was that when I use it while driving, people say that it sounds like i'm driving with the windows down when I'm actually not. I wouldn't recommend this product because of the sound clarity and range. $10-$20 more will be worth it.</text>

        <text>I just bought this piece of junk. I didn't use it the first night. I then charged it up overnight and used it. Seemed to work okay, but had some interference, probably from the WiFi hub I have about 10 feet away.When I let it charge overnight (like I charged it initially), I woke up and found the red "charging" indicator was out. Good. Fully charged. Then I tried to turn it on. Nothing. Dead. Nada. "Okay, I'll just plug it back in" Maybe 2-3 minutes later, the charging light stops. Let's try turning it on again. Nothing. Dead. Nada.Had I been ripped off? I doubted it. I've had a lot more problems with eBay than Amazon, which is why I switched. Being the problem solver I am, I searched "Plantronics 220 won't turn on." The best advice I got from NON-PLANTRONICS people (AKA other costumers) was to take the cover off and short the battery. I didn't want to muck around THAT much, so I called Plantronics "customer service." I called after hours and the system referred me to Plantronics.com. Thanks for nothing.Got up today and called again, business hours. THEY STILL REFERRED ME TO PLANTRONICS.COM AFTER 2 PROMPTS. Great people, right? So I went ahead and pried open the cover, which is easier said than done, and shorted the battery for a little while. Pressed the "let's make this do everything" button, and it turned on. SAVED! HALLELUJAH! Still worked with my phone. Then a couple minutes later, it died. Now I'm back to the troubling task of charging the stupid thing up. Will I have to pry it open again? Hopefully not.TL;DR? Don't buy Plantronics. Never again... 2 stars because it worked for a while.</text>

        <text>My original iPhone cord started coming apart at the connector after 6 months of use, and charging started becoming sporadic.  I decided to give this a shot, since it was under $2 shipped.When it arrived, the version I received looked very similar to the official iPhone cable, which was slightly disappointing as I had anticipated the thicker, more rugged version pictured and described (with reinforced connectors).  However, I plugged it in, and was pleasantly surprised that not only did it charge, but it performed data sync as well on my 3GS iPhone.Overall, I'm happy it works as intended, but had to give it 4 stars as it wasn't the tougher version pictured.  My guess is that it's a grab bag of what you get based on the large list of suppliers, so don't be surprised if it's not exactly as you're expecting.At $2, it's still better than buying the official $19 Apple version, and seems to have all the same functionality.EDIT: It looks like they are rotating different images of cords through the photo boxes.

        <text>I was looking for an extra cable so I can charge my iPhone 3GS from work if I forgot to charge it at home.  While searching through amazon, like you have, I came across several cables selling for $18+, and then I came across this product page and saw a picture with an odd looking cable for $1 and free shipping stating it will do the same thing as the $20 cables from Apple.  I was very skeptical and thought this was a fraud, and that most of the positive reviews must be fake or misleading.  Then I was like, "$1 risk, why not?"I have to state this is an amazing deal and it works.  First the picture does not look at all like what they send you.  They sent me a cable that looks exactly like the cable that comes out of the iPhone box.  It has the push buttons on the side to disconnect from the iPhone and fits a USB port perfectly.  It was shipped USPS and showed up within 5 days.  So I have no idea how these people are making a profit off selling these cables unless they are selling in major bulk.Not only is the product great, but I also have to give kudos to the seller.  I received my product in the mail, then the next day I got an email from the seller stating they had a fire in their warehouse and lost data on 2000 orders, so they have no idea if product was shipped on any of those orders and if I did not get it, to email them back and they will ship me another cable on just my word.  They were more concerned about their seller rating on amazon than ensuring that people did not get extra cables.  Most companies I've dealt with would wait for me to complain and then say, "Oh, we had a fire and we could not tell who it affected.  We'll take care of it now that you have complained."Great cable, great seller.</text>

        <text>I own/use a Plantronics 925, Jawbone Prime, and Jawbone Icon.  The Plantronics fits my ear great, but, doesn't decent noise canceling.  Both Jawbones have great audio, but, I found the Jawbone Prime's ear loop fragile and the buttons to be awkward; and found the Jawbone Icon's earloop to really suck (keeps coming off when I take off the headset and the loop gets caught).  Hence, I am trying the Sound ID 200 more for its ergonomics.For my particular ear, I found the Sound ID 200 to fit pretty well using the just the earlobe piece without the loop.  Of course, you mileage will vary here.The Sound ID 200's speaker was acceptable to me.  Voices came across naturally and the volume levels were fine.Unfortunately the Sound ID 200's mic results in my voice sound noticeably "tinny" to those I'm talking to when compared to the Plantronics and the Jawbones.I didn't find the button use on the Sound ID to be that difficult at all.  You do need to read the instructions though.One potential annoyance: the Sound ID 200 does not support initiating voice dialing from the Sound ID 200 like I can on other headsets.  The instructions have you push the appropriate voice dialing button your phone to get things going.  If the phone or headset happens to be in sleep mode and your bluetooth connection isn't currently active when you do this, you may not get the voice dialing feature to automatically start using the headset.I'm returning the Sound ID 200; it's not performing as well as I would like to replace my other headsets.  Might look into the more expensive Sound ID units to see if the microphone quality issue gets addressed.</text>

I returned it after 1 week.I DO NOT recommend this headset.</text>
    </sentence>
    <sentence id="8963">
        <text>As the Sound 20 is no longer a current model, the price has dropped significantly--I paid around $20 for mine. At that price it is a good bargain for anyone who wants a plain vanilla headset with decent sound quality. I find that the sound itself is excellent--far superior to any other bluetooth headset I've used. The device is simple and thus easy to use, and the design is a notch better than most of the devices out there. As for fit, the device sits in your ear rather than over it, though there is an optional ear loop. I find that it nestles comfortably in my ear so that I don't notice it's there. The downsides are that because it's not a current model there are a number of things it can't do, and in addition I find that the range is not that great--sound degrades rapidly once the earpiece is not in a direct line with the phone or other device.The device has one multicolored LED which is difficult to see if you are not looking directly at it. Mine came in the original packaging with additional ear pieces and was black not blue so I can't comment on the color. If you just need a headset (earpiece) for calls (no music) and can live without voice recognition, this can be a good buy.Update and why I changed this review from three to one star: Product was ok while it worked but item's internal battery stopped holding a charge after less than a year. Even though it is moderately inexpensive, that's substandard performance in my opinion since the item is worthless once it can't hold a charge.</text>

    <sentence id="8964">
        <text>It looks sleek and gets a lot of good reviews, but in my experience, it has not performed to expectation (not that I have particularly high standards). My chief complaints:1) the little rubber ear pieces that are supposed to hold it in your ear make for a good fit. BUT they incessantly break, forcing you to buy and replace them constantly.2) it is supposed to offer simplified use with only 2 buttons. BUT it requires you to figure out which combination of buttons to press, how long to hold it, when to let go and what to do next. It makes it surprisingly difficult to use. For example, I want to pair it with the phone but end up turning it off instead. (Does anyone else have this problem or am I just incompetent?)3) minor annoyance, but often times, it is difficult to tell if it is on or off. So often times, I think its off and I try to turn it on, just to find out that I just turned it off. The different colors on the light are supposed to indicate its current on/off state, but I just never seem to have good luck with it. (Again, may be it is just my incompetence?)However, there are some nice aspects: it looks sleek and is compact, fitting nicely in the ear. Battery life seems to be ok as well. I never found much use for the dual microphone noise reduction capability. People on the phone always told me that they could hear no difference when I used it.As a result of the challenges I found with it, I rarely find myself using it anymore. So the long and the short of it is that I am not very satisfied, certainly not at the price. My personal opinion is that it does not offer good value, considering how much you are forking out on it.I used the Plantronics Voyager 510 before and was quite satisfied with it before I lost it. Yes, it was a little bit large, but very usable, long battery life, etc. And it is less than half the price of this one. Based on my experience, I would recommend that one.Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging]</text>

        <text>It is a microUSB cable similar to the one that come with Samsung Products.  It does what it needs to do - charge the phone via computer USB port and wall plug as well as connect the phone/tablet for data transferring - and will work fine as long as you are easy on the connection heads.Why not five stars? It only because I find that microUSB cables tend to break faster then other cables (e.g. Apple's 30 Pin connector) and this cable is no different.  Don't get me wrong, this cable is plenty sturdy (and much sturdier then the retractable microUSB connectors), but at the end of the day, it is still relatively easy to break the connection head on accident.  Still haven't found a "large" version of Griffin's USB Mini-Cable Kit which allows you to bend and twist without breaking the cable.Also, I highly recommend the seller as the shipping is free and fast (at least to Southern California)!</text>

The rubberized cable is also about 1/2" longer and the label isn't as sharp as the other one. This cable could be made in another factory, or it may be counterfeit.

        <text>Ignore the Samsung name on this cable. It might well be a name branded cable. But it's not a particularly good cable--brand name or not. First off, it's relatively thin, similar to off-brand bargain basement cables. To be honest, this isn't a critical issue--even a thin cable can work. But it doesn't speak well to the longevity of the cable, or to the workmanship that likely went into it. (Let's face it, this is just a simple cable; but if they cheap out on cable thickness, who knows what the quality of internal construction might be).The second thing about this cable is that it's quite short--about 32" long, or a bit over 2.5 feet. That's OK for something attached to your laptop that's going to sit right next it, but it's too short to be comfortable for a general purpose phone charging cable, for example.OK, it's cheap. And I have used worse cables (even thinner). But just be aware of what this is, particularly the length, when deciding if this is going to be of use for you.</text>

When I got them, much faster than I expected, I was pretty happy at first, till I used them.They aren't the style in the photo nor are they replacement cables for Samsung. They take about a minute to register with the computer that the phone is plugged in (upwards of 2 minutes), and when connected, they don't allow sync to occur.When used as chargers (plugged in to USB outlet adapters), they take over 10 hours to get a dead battery to 80%! I though it could be the charger , so tried different ones. Also tried other devices (a Mifi, my GS3, a cheap Samsung flip phone), all with similar results: Mifi - from dead to 77% after 8 hours; GS3 - 10% to 60% after 7 hours; basic flip phone: dead to 75% after 8 hours.I also tried the other cable and repeated my tests: same results.I'll keep these to keep the charge (it'll keep my GS3 at it's current level for hours, as long as it's not under heavy usage), but I'm looking for better ones after this.</text>

        <text>I found that many adapters and power supplies had microSD connectors that were too big to fit into my new Samsung S5570 Galaxy Mini Android phone - the female plug inside the phone is recessed in such a way that the male connector must have a very slim housing to fit.  After ordering a few from Amazon and having none of them fit, I started visiting phone shops trying to find *anything* that would work.  I finally found one that fit, at an AT&amp;T retail store.  They had three in stock at $20 each.  It was in an AT&amp;T branded box but the cable was made by Belkin.  Anyway, I wanted five of them to keep at various places where I might want to sync and/or charge my phone, so that would have been $100 plus tax.  Compare that to the roughly $6 I paid for five of these here on Amazon.  And these aren't charge-only cables, they will both charge and connect your phone to your computer via USB.  If you're looking to charge/connect a Samsung with a microSD, stop looking and buy this.</text>

The prongs that make the connection start to fail by not sticking up as much as they should.  When the problem first starts, I have to wiggle the cord to make a connection.  It continues to get worse so that I have to wrap the cord around the phone and do other things to make sure it is plugged in at a certain angle.

    <sentence id="9162">
        <text>This cable is an economical choice for a backup to the cable that came with your device. It is a short, 9&amp;#34; cable, which means that it delivers full charging voltage and data transfer capability; longer cables may have issues with data transfer, due to resistive losses in the wire conductors, which increase as the cable gets longer.  For example, I have a 6' cable which charges my device okay, but will not connect to a PC for data transfer.  I recommend getting a couple of these so you can leave one at home and the other at work or in your car. It should charge any device that uses a Micro-USB connection, not just Samsung brand smart phones, but it may cause the device to actually boot up (my Tracfone LG-840G does this with this cable; why, I don't know).</text>

        <text>This arrived fast, can't beat the price (I paid $1.69 with free shipping), and haven't had any problems with data transfer or charging.However, this is a cheap Chinese knockoff, NOT 3 feet as advertised (my OEM cord for my Samsung Galaxy is 3 feet). This is 6" too short, which means if plugging into a wall outlet, it has to stay on the floor - not long enough to reach the table. What a hassle if you have kids or pets.It only measures 2.5 feet, and it's surprising how often that extra 6" matters. Also, you can tell it's built cheaper than the OEM cord - I expect it will short out, probably won't last 6 months.But hey, for the price I can't complain too much.

        <text>I've been using these cables for a while now, and they work fine. They move data, they charge... they do what they're supposed to do. However, I noticed recently that my devices (Samsung GS4 and Nexus 7) charged more quickly on some cables than on others, so I installed CurrentWidget and did a bunch of careful testing.Using my phone as an example, it uses 460mA of power to function, and I leave it on while charging. These cables will charge it at 1000mA (5W) total input power, which leaves 540mA (2.7W) dedicated to charging the battery after subtracting what the phone uses. There's nothing wrong with that. But other cables are able to deliver 1.66A (8.3W) to my device which means that charging happens at 1200mA (6W), and charging happens over TWICE as fast.I have no real complaint with these cables, but I prefer to use the other, faster cables instead.</text>

        <text>These cables are true Samsung connectors, at a fraction (i.e., ~10%) of the cost for the same items direct from Samsung.  These work with my Galaxy S II for charging from the many computers in my life:  two at home, one at work, and one in the car.  For the car, I already had a double USB charger, and this cable replaced my iPhone cable wonderfully.  One thing I did notice, this cable could not charge from an iPhone/iPod wall charger, even though it has a female USB interface as part of it. I blame Apple for not making standard components.  The wall charger shipped with the Galaxy S II works great.</text>

        <text>Seriously, why don't they just make it last. I am pretty sure I went through two if not three of these. I thought I made a great find for a replacement cable for my GS2. But I threw both away. They would not connect well or be loose so it wouldn't charge. I had the hardest time finding the right cable. Ironically I found an amazing short and super long one that work awesome. The short Nokia CA-101D 8-inch Connectivity Cable for Nokia (search that on amazon) It connects well and is very solid. Should also work for GS3 but that I don't own. Then the long Mediabridge High Speed USB 2.0 A-Male to Micro-B Cable - 6 feet (also amazon) that is amazing quality, just increadibly long! But good luck searching. Hopefully those two suggestions will help you find your answer.

        <text>This is my first set of bluetooth headphones and they work great, for the most part. I use these with my Touch Pro 2 and the Pocketplayer App. The controls are great and it's comfotable. Only two complaints. First is sound quality, the sound is clear and decent highs just not enough bass for me. I'm use to the Shure SE530's with is in a class of it's own. So for the normal person that is use to the standard Ipod ear buds they are going to sound great. The second grips is if I have my device on my hip the sound cuts out sometimes when i'm working out but if I just set it on a bench or on the floor under the gym I can walk around about a 25ft radius with no problem, kinda odd but it's cool. It's worth the money.</text>

        <text>It's even worse when my phone is in my pocket and I bend over, but the sound will (sometimes) cut out every second or two while I'm holding the phone 18" away.  Checking with Motorola about warranty, but really disappointing.</text>

        <text>I LOVE these head phones. I've paired them with my ipod (had to get an adapter for that). Paired them with my cell phone. Paired them with my computer and ancient bluetooth adapter. I love them. The SRS WOW built into the headphones makes music sound soooo much better. My only wish is that they blocked out environmental noise a little better, but maybe it will be a side benefit that i can listen to music while riding my bike and not have all sound totally eliminated, just wish it had better sound isolation for wearing em on the subway, but i guess that's okay.UPDATE: (One day later)..The headphones no longer have stereo sound. After chatting with Motorola I have to send them in, they are defective, I didn't accidentally hit a mono button, they are defective and have to go back after only one day! I did nothing to them except charge them overnight and leave them sitting on a shelf. I have no idea how a product could break like this. I've never had an experience like this before. Still they sounded amazing when they were working, hopefully the replacements will be more reliable. I really look forward to a continued good experience with these headphones when they are replaced and hope I can continue to rave about them.</text>

        <text>Ive been using this product for over a year. The sound is great but the voice calls are not usable, but could be just the set I have.I use it for running and the gym. The only issues at the gym I have is on the seats of the machines or on a bench the back part of the bluetooth bumps against it pushing the headset out of my ears.I am happy with this headsets but there are many new and better style headsets out there now.</text>

        <text>I originally bought the S9's, which sounded O.K., but failed after one 30 minute workout with moderate sweating.  I said in a review of those that I was going to try the Jaybird's, but I liked the S9's so much that I decided to try the S9 HD's instead.  I had read that the S9 HD's were much improved in sweat resistance.  Not true.On the positive, I will say there is no comparison between the S9's and the S9 HD's as far as sound quality.  The HD's simply blow the older model away.  I was very happy with them initially, although I was so paranoid after my earlier short lived experience, that I found myself CONSTANTLY wiping the headphones off to make sure they didn't get wet while working out.  Well, even that didn't work.  Sadly after only 3 workouts, these too have failed.  This time the headphones themselves still function, as well as the volume controls, however the pause, phone, and forward/back controls have all failed.  Sigh...I really do want to like these headphones, but they are obviously not an appropriate product if you want to use them for workouts.  At least they had the decency to fail within the 30 day return period!This time I actually did order the Jaybirds instead.  I know they don't have the same audio quality as these do, but hopefully they will function for over a week!UPDATE:  I looked at my review this morning, and decided that I was too harsh in rating these 1 star (although I can't go back and change that).  They really are very good as far as sound quality, and if you aren't using them for workouts, then you will probably really like them.  It's just the only time I ever use headphones is during workouts, so for me at least they are unacceptable.</text>

        <text>Very portable, connects easily, relatively comfortable. Sound could be better but then I have been spoiled by those little earbuds that actually insert into the ear canal - you can't beat the sound on those.

        <text>I decided to totally rewrite this review. I finally started using these again hoping I could cope with the worst bluetooth range I have ever seen to date, and sorry, I can't take it.Pros:The sound quality is great. It's some of the best I've ever had for Bluetooth Headphones.I haven't had sweat problems at the gym like other people seem to have had.They are very lightweight, although it would be nicer if it was lower so you could lay down with them on.Cons:The rubber glue holding the power button rubber unglued itself.The battery life is about 5 hours... not bad for the size, but not really that great either.Motorola technical support is some of the worst ever conceived, it's a joke to even call it that.They bend pretty easy - if you take these on a road trip, make sure they don't have /any/ weight on them. Mine bent to the left pretty heavy and took some time to bend back.But the real meat and potatoes is that THESE HAVE THE WORST WIRELESS RANGE IN THE HISTORY OF WIRELESS.I have to put my phone in my hood to get the sound to not cut out nonstop. Pockets? Sorry, you are SOL. Like working out? It works, kind of. Biking with your phone in your pocket is a long lost dream. I didn't buy these - My HT820 (which by the way was AMAZING compared to these) went in for warranty, and they sent me these back. No charger, no manual, nothing but these in a box (and they weren't even bubble wrapped!) and then when I contacted them about it, they said my warranty had expired. That might be due to the fact that it TOOK NEARLY 3 WEEKS to get a response. Getting an RMA on my previous set so bad that I am never buying Motorola again.Overall, I really dislike these headphones because there is no practical use. Look at the 1 star reviews, and you'll see what I have.I cannot repeat this enough: DO NOT BUY THESE, SAVE YOURSELF THE HORRORS OF THIS PIECE OF TRASH (for lack of better words)Update: I have upgraded to the Nokia BH-905i - I like BT headphones and I'm not going to throw my money away on another pair of these losers. The sound doesn't cut out on my (new) phone with the new pair - it still does with the old (these). When I did upgrade my phone (from when I wrote the top part of this review), I tested out the BT range, and sadly, the problem did lie in these headphones. I want to like them, but with all of the problems, there is nothing about these to like.</text>

        <text>This is the first bluetooth headset that I bought. The first few days it worked ok but I noticed I had to recharge it after every couple of hours that was used. Then I started hearing a lot of static noice (I was not walking around, sitting next to my laptop). Bottom line, don't waste your money, there is a reason this headset was so cheap. Who knows maybe a more expensive one does a better job.</text>

        <text>I am a runner and have been using these headphones for the past four years with different devices on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors. Currently I use them with my iPhone 4S, with which this headset paired effortlessly. However I am now on my third headset.After about a year the battery did not seem to be holding a charge, and I got a replacement headset. I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues, though I have no idea how widespread that is.Soon after getting that replacement I started going to a gym where the treadmill area was not well ventilated and tended to be humid. I got drenched in sweat and so did the headset. The volume control stopped working (it was stuck on the highest volume) and there was static coming out of one of the ear buds. Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be "zapped" by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant. It appears that this headset is not. It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my first gym. I have since switched gyms, and my new gym is well ventilated. I also wear the Buff (which I have reviewed on Amazon) when I run. Since this covers my entire head and is great for absorbing sweat, including sweat on the back of my neck, the sweat is no longer an issue for me.Note: If you want a corded headset to use when sweat will be an issue, I suggest the Sennheiser PMX 70, which I have reviewed on Amazon.In any event, my latest headset has been working just fine for the past three years.Before purchasing this headset, you should keep some things in mind.First, depending on what device you use, it may be necessary to buy a separate blue tooth adapter (I had to do that when I used this headset with an iPod).Second, if you wear glasses, it works best to put the headset on first and the glasses on second. The glasses won't fit quite as snugly as they normally do, but for exercise it will be fine. I found that if I put my sunglasses on first, the headset did not fit as snugly in my ears, with a resulting loss in sound. The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana--put the headset on first.Third, since the headset is curved in the back, if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back, the collar will push against the headset, which will come slightly out of its position in your ears. So wearing the headset with a ski jacket won't work very well. With a thinner collar, you will occasionally have to reposition the headset as the collar pushes against it. Also, if you wear a ski hat to run, you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth, because of the back of the neck design, you will not be able to use this headset comfortably to lay on your back (like on a blanket at the beach, a couch in your den, a chaise lounge by the pool) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back (like in a car or airplane). Likewise you will need to remove it to use certain equipment at the gym, like the situp bench.All in all I am very satisfied with this product now that I have resolved the sweat issue.Update March 17, 2012: I figured out how to use this headset comfortably to lay on my back. Turn the headset upside down (So the M now looks like a W), put it in back of your head, and put the earbuds into your ears without looping anything over your hears like you usually do. The back of the headset will now be flush against your neck, and you can comfortably lay back on a beach chair etc. Keep in mind that now the phone button and volume controls will be on your right ear instead of your left ear. I can't believe that I didn't think of this sooner.</text>

        <text>I bought this battery replacement kit from BestDealsUSA for my Apple iPhone 3G.  The kit arrived with all the tools necessary, although it would have been more helpful if the screwdrivers were magnetic.  As for installation directions, I just followed videos posted on YouTube and it took me about 45 minutes to complete (I could have finished earlier but those tiny screws were hard for me to handle).After installing the battery, I re-calibrated the iPhone with the new battery by doing the following:1.  Reset the iPhone by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button for at least 10 seconds until the Apple logo appears (you will not lose any apps or data stored on the iPhone).2.  Drained the battery until the iPhone shuts off automatically (by playing music, videos, games, making phone calls, etc).3.  Fully charge the iPhone (yes, you may use it while charging).After two days, I can definitely say the new battery is holding up very well on my iPhone.  Let's see how it does after a month or so...</text>

This battery seems to work just as bad as the original one I've had for a few years.When I received it, it had about 70% life and I decided to fully charge it and then let it completely die before recharging. I've been using it for a few days and I charge it fully each night. By the end of the day, which is around 5 or 6pm for me, it's down to less than 20%. I rarely use my phone during the day while I'm at work. I even tried taking off the autosync feature to save battery life. Last night as usual I fully charged the battery. I've checked my email and received/sent a few text messages. It's now noon and the battery is at 44%!I believe there are some lower priced batteries out there that actually work.

        <text>If you want this phone because of the supposed IMAP client, you might be disappointed.  There are other problems too, but I'll start with the long one.If you have it already, and set up your email by following all of the menu prompts, you might like it just fine without realizing what it is actually doing.The way life ought to work, and does on other phones:If you have an IMAP email phone, and an email service which supports IMAP, you get free "push" email (instant delivery, not waiting for the next dial-up) with no extra charge beyond your data plan.  Very simple.Nokia doesn't seem to care.  There is an option for email alerts, but it doesn't seem to actually work unless you agree to the terms of their new "Nokia Messaging" service.  Instead of the phone connecting directly with your email provider (eg, GMail), the phone installs the Nokia application which connects with Nokia's server, and that server at Nokia is actually connected with your email provider.  Not only is this a ghetto work-around, but if you read the terms of the service, it is only free until Nokia decides they are done "testing" it and want to charge you money.So you might be happily using what you think is IMAP push email on this phone, and for all we know it could stop working next month and Nokia could demand that you pay their subscription fee... for something which ought to just work anyway.No pretend that this doesn't matter to you, or you think I am nuts, etc.  On to the next problem.If your email provider has IMAP available, the phone will not allow you to set it to download whole email messages.  The setting option which allows either "headers only" or header+body when you use POP3 is neutered when you have an IMAP server address, and the only option is headers only.  So if you look at your phone and see several new emails, every time you click on it you have to wait for it to connect and load the email.  My SonyEricsson w595 is not so stupid.  I have instant IMAP delivery, and get the body text automatically.So forget about the email client, what about other Internet applications?Here's two problems with that stuff:1. You can't turn off the menu option which stupidly asks if you really want to allow a web browser to access the Internet... every single time you use it.  Other phones at least skip this if you installed a signed application (eg, Opera or Bolt browsers).  The popup has no "never ask" option, and there is no setting for it from the application manager either.  Only Nokia's own browser is exempt.2. The fancy e63 also lets you select an "access point" every time you do something which requires Internet access.  This would be a great feature if you use both WiFi and cellular, and want to switch back and forth all the time.  But it's a total annoyance if you don't.  The e63 lets you turn this "feature" off for its own web browser, but it still does it for everything else.  Google maps, Bolt browser, GMail application... every one makes you select the access point every time you use it.</text>

        <text>I've always wanted to own a smartphone, but did not want to pay the usurious rates charged by carriers for regular phone+data service. This smartphone is the answer to my wishes. Amazon's hit it out of the park on pricing.The phone hardware is beautifully engineered. While some have panned its camera, I've found it usable. When you first use the keyboard, you might think that with the small keys, you'll fat-finger everything, but surprisingly it works very well. The phone has a plethora of features.I've used my phone with prepaid voice service from T-Mobile. You'll need a SIM card and some airtime. I chose not to buy any data packages, but instead, configure the browser and email to work with wi-fi. The advantage is that wi-fi service at home and many hotels and cafes is free, so you have mobile internet access. The disadvantage is that you don't get mail and web unless you're within range of a wi-fi signal, and you pretty much become your own systems integrator, trying to get all the components to work seamlessly.The manual that comes with the product is close to being useless. It goes on and on about various pieces of jargon, without once explaining what they are, and what purpose they serve. I tried in vain to connect the in-built mail client to Yahoo, but failed because it insists on connecting via IMAP and Yahoo does not do IMAP. There is no way to specify POP. After a day of web browsing I came up on a workaround using a fake email domain name to trick the software into working with Yahoo. You'll have more work to do in setting up the various pieces of software so that they use your wi-fi connection and not the cellular 3G connection.Nokia has a separate push email service that is very poorly documented, and is _separate_ from the email software that comes on the phone. This service works superbly with Yahoo and other email services like Gmail. However figuring out how to change the email icon to start this email as opposed to the stock email program that came with the device takes a good amount of doing. Once you've set it up, you can get it to work so that the email key and icon go directly to the Nokia push email.The bottom line: if you are familiar with setting up electronic gadgetry, know something about various types of networks, and have a day or two to spare in googling, you can set up the phone to work on prepaid, with wi-fi for data service. The hardware is great, and once you've gone past the setup hassles, the software works well.If technology intimidates you, then buy this phone from a carrier, or go for a Blackberry or Iphone. With a phone that you buy from a carrier, you get the carrier to do all the integration with their network, and a number to call if something doesn't work. Of course the downside is the much higher monthly cost.</text>

        <text>I am fairly technically oriented -- so tried taking this directly out of the box to use it.  I chose the red phone and the outside cover feels velvety to me.  It doesn't slide around when you set it on a hard surface in the car....which is good.My main complaint is that the written instructions are absolutely useless.  After taking the back off - the cover has a toggle that unlatches in the back and it pivots on a hook at the top of the phone.  Take out the battery and to get your sim card in the phone, slide it VERTICALLY into the little area that looks like you should insert a memory card horizontally.  The guy at the ATT store had to show me how to do this.  Even my 13 year old could not figure it out -- which is generally not a good sign.I agree with other reviewers that the keyboard layout is awesome.  It makes the phone narrower than a BB and is easy to use.  The other trick I had to learn the hard way - is how to unlock the sucker after setting it up with no password.  you have to quickly press in sequence the bar above the green call button and then the function button near the lower left corner of the keyboard.  You can't hold one of the buttons down too long or it ignores you.  When the screen dims, I have a really hard time reading error messages and instructions on the screen.... hmmm.  again, a pain.However, the phone will let you set font size, background color and there is a plethera of pleasing ringtones.  If only the applications were as abundant.I chose this phone because of the wi-fi capabilities.  I do not have a data plan, don't want a data plan, but do need the calendar and email functions.  I can sync and read email at any starbucks and still avoid the overpriced ATT data service.If you still think this is a US phone, read the manual and screen where it instructs you to hold the space bar down for 2-3 seconds to use the phone as a torch (flashlight).  I have actually found this functionality to be VERY useful and even when you don't charge your phone for 3 - 4 days, it will still light up like a beacon in the dark.  Try going 24 hours without charging your  BB bold!bottom line, I would buy it again for the wi-fi and great sound transmission (both out and in).  I love the size, but wish it came with useful user docs.</text>

        <text>i have an iphone, an HTC hero from sprint, and I recently got this phone. I initially bought the iPhone to use as my work phone since my company uses AT&amp;T. I loved the iPhone as a gadget since I am always an apple fan. However, the device has lots of issues from a business user's perspective. My main complain was the flimsy alarms for meetings. There is no way you can customize the alert tones in that phone. HTC hero is a very new product that I use for my personal use from Sprint. I like the device but the bluetooth sucks on this device. I paired it with my car's hands free connection, and the hero stopped connecting to the car from the next use. I think Sprint needs a major bug fix on the bluetooth area of this device. With all said, the e63 keeps making me happy. i love the utility of this device. I do not have a data plan since my company uses text messages for paging since it is cheaper than blackberry service. This has not been an issue since I have wifi on this phone. The bluetooth stereo works seamlessly with my car. the call and signal quality is perfect. I can synch the phone with both my outlook at work and my music on iTunes on an iMac at home. it even transfers the new podcasts. I have a 2 GB card in this phone. This is more than enough for my use as I only have a hundred or so songs that i listen to. I listen to a lot of financial and news podcasts. To make things more sweeter, the music transfer is possible over bluetooth. Apple does not allow that even on their own iPhone from a mac. Don't get me wrong, I love the macs, but I think Apple does not know how to make a perfect phone yet. They still need to learn a lot from an experienced phone maker like Nokia. My specific unit was manufactured in Finland. Has an excellent workmanship on the product. The keys are smooth. Much better than the virtual keyboard that iPhone or the hero sports. The device has a substantial feeling as not too light and not too bulky.  Did I mention the FM radio and the nice web browser? well, buy one and enjoy if you are a serious business user who is not too crazy about a berry.</text>

        <text>I have had my Nokia E63 for almost three years now. I use it all the time as a phone and as my primary MP3 player, using a 16 GB micro SD card to hold more programs and albums than I could possibly listen to. This phone is still going strong despite many years of hard use.Maybe it qualified as a "smart" phone when it came out, but now (entering 2013), it could only be considered semi-smart at best. A dinosaur, perhaps, but it does what I need it to do well.It has wi-fi capability so you can check e-mail or Facebook, etc without using a data plan. This was key for me.The cellphone reception is excellent. For the first couple of years I had the phone, I was working in Mexico over two miles south of the border, and I could still get a US signal when phones of my colleagues were roaming. The great reception and durable build quality are what has kept me with Nokia phones for almost ten years.The MP3 player sounds great coming through the stereo system on my car, but it does tend to be a little hissy with most earbuds -- especially any that say "designed for iPhone". A major exception is thePanasonic RPHJE120K. While a little short on bass, these are my favorite budget earphones at just over $5, and the sound with the Nokia is angelic and crystal clear.In the end, I'm aiming for five years with this phone. I plan to upgrade in around 2014 and I have no reason to think my E63 will give out on me before then. Hopefully one of Nokia's beautiful new smartphones that really deserve the name will be more affordable by then.</text>

        <text>This little adapter earns its 5 stars for solving a true problem and doing it so without me having to pay a lot for the privilege. But, first, let's enumerate its specs:- Input 100-240V - at this price dual voltage, amazing. You would need a plug adapter if you go abroad and it's not included.- AC - 50-60Hz - we have 50Hz, they use 50Hz in Europe.- Output DC - 5.0V- Interface - USB female A-type- Little "I'm alive" red light so you'll know that it's charging- USB cord - not includedI bought this to charge theFlip MinoHD Camcorder  2nd Generationa great little cam that comes without a charger and expects that you either carry a laptop and have it hang on it USB port to charge it or you pay lots of $$ to buy the 'extra' charger from Flip. To my surprise and joy, this little adapter coupled with a relatively inexpensiveAmazonBasics  USB 2.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension Cable (3.3 Feet / 1.0 Meter)fully charged my MinoHD in about 90 minutes without any issues.By the way, those who market this device may sell more if the mention the Clip compatibility. I do own aSanDisk Sansa Clip+ 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)and I didn't need this adapter because the Sansa takes its charge through a female Mini USB A-type and any Blackberry or phone charger with a male Mini-USB B-type would charge it.To conclude: IT WORKS and at this price with free shipping (no $25 minimum required) it's almost a steal. I'll probably order another one, just in case.</text>

        <text>I used this charger for about 6 months, pretty sporadically, with my Droid X &amp; Sansa Clip+ as the two primary recipients of recharges straight from the wall outlet as opposed to a computer's USB port.  Everything worked fine, except I'd notice the units were slightly warmer to the touch than if they were charging from the computer, or in the case of the Droid X, from the Motorola shipped wall-to-USB charger.A few weeks ago, I left my Sansa plugged in for a few hours for a full charge (usually takes about 3-4 hrs to charge from empty).  When I came back, it was completely dead, and very warm to the touch.  I smelled something that could've been burnt wires, but could've just been the plastic--very hard to tell.  All attempts to restart the Sansa failed, and I RMA'ed it.  I've since stopped using this adapter for any of my electronic devices.I can't blame the charger for the Sansa's death with 100% certainty so I'm giving it 2* instead of 1*, but considering I don't feel comfortable using it ever again, I'm not going to give it any higher rating.  User beware, I guess.</text>

        <text>This skin is definitely worth buying and for this price I'd say go for it. There are some flaws and depending on your use I'd say they are minimal at worst!1. The skin around the touch screen lock/unlock should have been thinner, .. it'll irritate you no end in the beginning but you get used to it. You could use a fine file to make the area more accessible.2. The 2nd camera for video conf. is hidden by about a 1/2 mm and produces a dark corner. Cut out carefully just the area of the skin that overlaps or slip the corner off while conferencing, if it bugs you. It doesn't really bother me since I don't use the camera much!3. If you use the lanyard its a problem when you want to use the car attachment when using the GPS. You need to slip the skin off but you cant get it off entirely because of the size of the hole. Slipping on the lanyard is also a pain but since you wont do this every day it's OK I guess.All in all a good buy. I considered buying a leather case, but they were too bulky. This skin is perfect barring the above defects. So far so good anyway ... its been 3 months since I got mine. I receive the package as promised too. I also got the 3 pack screen protector from the same vendor</text>

        <text>The cover gives a good protection, does not slide over table and gives a nice feeling when in hand (in $3 one cannot expect much). However, there are many cons1. The lock is difficult to reach since the silicone is pretty thick.2. The case is lose and the side covers comes out in day to day handling.3. Dust very easily sticks to this cover, giving it a dirty look.4. You cannot put the phone in your pocket with the cover on, it doesn't slide into your pocket because of the rubber material. This a big problem for people who keep their phone in pocket (like me)Ended up ordering the Otterbox commuter case for $30.My suggestion, do not waste your three dollars on this case.</text>

It is easy to slip the case on and off my phone in case I need to access the battery, SD or SIM cards.A couple of small gripes. It is hard to access the sliding phone-lock button since it is hidden deep in the open slot.

        <text>This skin was a breeze to slip on, and it seems to easily come off when I need it to.  That said, it also sticks tight when I *don't* want it to easily come off.That's the good news.  The bad news is not too bad:- you'll need to think ahead if you're going to stick the plectrum and wrist strap on:  feed that through the skin from the outside, thread it into the catch inside the XPressMusic's battery cover, then slip all the the skin around the phone.  Tricky, but it can be done.- access to the sides is not very easy:  it's nice that you can still press the volume buttons, but annoying that you have to mash down hard to flip the unlock switch:  the opening is too narrow and the skin is too thick.

No, you won't have booming bass but there is good depth that will more than fill a room and allow you to hear it from 20 feet or more at the beach. And the blue tooth has great range. Works even when phone is down stairs...although seriously how often are you going to really need that? But easily will reach 20 feet outdoor if needed and your phone can also send that far. Speaker phone works decent although probably not as good as a dedicated blue tooth phone device. Callers have told me it is hard to hear unless I am very close to the mic.</text>

        <text>After reading customer service problems with Jambox, I bought my wife a Jabra Solemate for Christmas.  She wanted to use her iPhone 4s for music and as a speakerphone in her office at work.  The Solemate ($150) works perfectly.  After a couple days, she said to me, &amp;#34;You've got to get one of these for yourself.&amp;#34;  Well, we can't really afford two $150 Bluetooth speakers, so I searched for something less expensive.  I found this one.First thing.  Unlike others, this does NOT use a USB-based adapter/charger, but rather it uses a conventional AC adapter and AA batteries.  That means you can't power it with a USB port on the computer, a USB AC Adapter, or a USB car adapter, and that's an inconvenience by modern standards.  Also, the AC adapter is just that.  It will power the device, but it is not a charger.  You could use rechargeable AA batteries in this, but you'll have to charge them separately.As a speakerphone, this device is only OK.  Speakerphone volume (with iPhone 4s) is so low, you have to turn the volume up all the way.  That means, when you get a call, you must quickly hit the volume up and hold it until it hits max.  Then when you hang up the call, just as quickly turn the volume back down, or music will be too loud.  I suppose if you had a phone with separate volume controls for phone and music, this could work better.  iPhone has one volume control, though.The sound is pretty good, albeit not the quality of the $150 Solemate.  Buttons on top of the device are handy.  Rewind-Pause/Play-FF, Volume down/up, Bass Boost, Stereo widening, PTT, and Power.  Bass Boost has fairly little, but noticeable effect.  Stereo widening, similarly, has little effect--mostly reduces volume and leaves a &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34; in the center of the sound.  PTT is for pairing and then to answer or ignore an incoming call.Pairing with the iPhone is easy enough, and the pairing survives the device being turned of and on again. It doesn't have voice prompts and confirmations like the Solemate, but at least the pairing instructions are on a label on the back of the device.  I also tried this briefly with an iPad, with which it also connected easily enough--given the usual Bluetooth constraints (disconnect from one before connecting to another).  iTunes music played fine.  Netflix movie sound comes through very well on the iPad.Bottom line:  If you're buying this mainly to listen to music or movies on a phone or tablet, it works well enough for about 37% of the price of the Solemate.  For music and movies, I'd give it 4 stars (one off for the old-style power).  As a speakerphone device for the iPhone, it's somewhat limited due to speaker volume issues.</text>

        <text>I picked this up on Cyber Monday in November 2012.  It's been a little less than 5 months and I couldn't be happier with this speaker.  I use some rechargeable batteries in it when I don't have it plugged into the wall.  The batteries seem to last about 8 hours total before dying.  The sound is great for the price.My only complaint is the flashing blue light on the front of the speaker.  It flashes when it is connected to a device and if you are using this in a dark room to watch a movie, it can be very distracting.  A piece of black electrical tape would easily fix this though.</text>

        <text>Lets be honest, the need for devices to compress(degrade) the music before sending it over bluetooth to a speaker inherently makes any speaker sound underwhelming. This speaker is no different. Use this speaker with a wire(3.5 mm) and it sounds great. Use it via Bluetooth with a great high bitrate mp3 and it sounds good. Use it to stream Slacker/Pandora via your mobile(already compressed to send to your phone) via bluetooth and it sound HORRIBLE . After owning 8 different speakers, i have come to the conclusion that as long as your expectations are realistic,you can be less critical. Only the Motorola EQ7 has impressed me in all areas. Yet that was 150$ brand new 3 years ago. This is a 50$ speaker. So i grade it as a 50$ speaker. Pound for pound it earns its 5 stars. Why do you ask? First is battery life,with 4 Power Ex AA batteries it gives me 8 to 10 hours at its highest volumes...perfect for a day at work or the beach. Second is durability, i have dropped it 7 times on hard concrete floors..batteries popped out cover went flying and it has not cracked or missed a beat.Third is its size a shape, It slides in to any pocket i have,my side pocket in my car and while not being tiny it is convenient when moving to place to place. 4th and finally is value/price at 50 dollars it is a great value it takes rechargeable batteries so i keep 4 in reserve and it takes A/C power too. I am not wealthy, yet if i lost it or it broke I would not be devastated(unlike my EQ7 which would have killed me even before it was discontinued) because 50$ is a price point I can deal with. So as far as I am concerned I highly recommend this speaker and use it EVERYDAY with great results.</text>

        <text>This is an excellent little gadget.  It's no Bose speaker, but the sound has good quality (excellent for the price), is quite loud and really clear for a wireless speaker.  I use it to channel internet radio from my iPhone in the kitchen and dining rooms and it reliably fills the room with crisp, clear sound with no defects from about 20 feet if my iPhone has an unobstructed view - half that from my pocket.The unit pairs easily, is a great size with a curved shape and a high-quality weight to it with the batteries installed.  The unit comes with a plug, but accepts 4 AA batteries.  Even full of batteries, it goes to sleep if you disconnect it from wall power.  I would've liked it to be able to &amp;#34;switch&amp;#34; to battery mode instantaneously and keep it moving, but you have to restart it manually.  Still, the batteries mean we get open-air internet radio or MP3 music at the park or wherever.The phone speaker feature is a real bonus.  An interesting side effect is that, while the microphone is good, it's easy to forget that the other party cannot hear you if you are more than a reasonable distance away from the microphone.  It's not a flaw because I'd never have a conversation with a real person or even a Polycom from that distance, but the speaker is so powerful that it makes you want to respond in your normal voice (which doesn't help the caller).Another non-flaw is that you can only pair one device at a time.  The paired device has to disconnect before another device can use it.  This is no different than if you had a wired connection, but is mildly irritating that I have to manually disconnect my phone or iPad before my wife can use it.</text>

        <text>The speaker connects to audio sources pretty well. Controls are a bit confusing but acceptable. Audio quality though has nothing to do with manufacturers claims: it is a small speaker with average audio, meaning it is only usable to voice applications such as Skype or other VTC apps. It is not suitable for music playback.</text>

        <text>The Spracht AURA BluNote Bluetooth speaker originally sold for $130 which is an absurd price considering its cheap build quality and barely acceptable sound quality. I purchased mine for about 60% less than that and still feel this speaker is an inferior value. The sound is simply too poor to make this suitable for any sort of serious music listening. No dynamic range or anything resembling bass. And forget about playing it loud. When a company releases a product this poor it makes me question it as a whole. Pass on Spracht and spend your money on brand that shows concern for product quality.</text>

        <text>I purchased this speaker because I want to have wireless speakers for my nexus one. Actually, I puchased Yubz MAGNUM and this unit.Both use 4 AA battery, I soon realized this speaker does not support AVRCP, as well as you have to connect from the host (a big hassle). I connect it as "wireless headphones" not "handsfree".The volume and bass control are reset once you have battery replaced, which is another hassle.Now I say the good side: the sound is pretty decent. The speaker has bass boost and stereo widening, the former does really work.I never use handsfree speaker, so I can't give comments.If you want to use it as wireless audio speakers and you want to control from the speaker, you should go elsewhere.</text>

        <text>first of all, it sounds like crappy little cheap speakers, which is basically what I was expecting so I can't complain about that. The bluetooth seems to work fine but I really only get about 20-25 feet if it is a clear line of sight, even if I walk between my phone and the speaker it will cut out. There are also a few things about it that really annoy me. When you power the speaker on the volume is set so low be default that you cannot even hear sound coming from it, even if my cell phone is turned all the way up. Once you get the volume at a decent level everything is great until you go to turn the speaker off it plays this cheesy chiming noise at the an outrageous volume level because that his how loud I had to turn up the speaker to be able to hear them. My initial solution was to just leave the speaker turned on and only turn on my bluetooth to connect when I want to listen to music, however there is a flashing blue light on the front which lights up our entire basement when it flashes every 10 seconds. We just covered up the light, but if it wasn't for the weird volume issues this wouldn't be a problem to begin with.</text>

    <sentence id="9407">
        <text>After a couple months of use, I'm editing my review to take away one star.  All the below holds true, but the blue light is actually incredibly annoying.  It flashes quickly and randomly as long as the unit is turned on, so I end up hiding the speaker out of my line of sight.  It's a serious design flaw in a speaker that's obviously trying to be sleek, modern, and easy to fit into your decor.----I bought this little speaker to use with my Nexus One, which holds about 12G of my music collection.  The convenience of the Bluetooth connection and the small footprint sold me on this model, and it does not disappoint.Pros:1.  Setup was seamless and took a total of 45 seconds, thirty of which was waiting for my phone's Bluetooth to recognize the speaker.2.  Size matters for a portable speaker, and this one has a small footprint. The slight curve makes it stable enough to not worry about tipping, but it takes up less desk space than my 5x7 digital photo frame.3.  Design is good, with a nice sleek appearance.  The buttons have a good, solid feel, and they're nicely sized so there's no hunting around.4.  The sound is also very good, but no one is going to mistake it for a full-size speaker.5.  The unit comes with an AC adapter, four AA batteries, and an Aux-in cable.  Everything I needed to get my Nexus One and iPod both connected in no time.Cons:1.  The sound does have some sibilance, particularly on high notes.  It's not really a tinny sound - much better than most other portable speakers of this size that I've tried.  That said, it's not going to blow you away with sound quality.2.  The blue lights on the front of the unit (not shown in the pictures) are, well, ugly and distracting.  Where the photo shows three connecting black circles, the unit has blue circular lights when turned on.  Only the top circle is lit most of the time, but it's pretty bright.  Definitely not a design enhancement, and a downright annoyance if you want to sleep with this thing going.Overall, I'm very happy with this speaker and am glad to have it.  The complete ease of connecting my devices, the size and portability, and the decent sound quality outweigh the negatives for me.  And since I bought it at the Goldbox price, I'd say it was worth the money.  Not sure I'd be as happy if I'd paid the regular price, though!</text>

        <text>I had no trouble pairing this with my DROID X mobile phone and playing music through it at a reasonably high volume - the sound quality is what it is for this size speaker, but that's not what I bought it for. I bought this to use as a speakerphone and in that regard, it falls a bit short. The speaker volume is WAY down and not as clear as it should be - I have a Motorola speaker/speakerphone that's about a third the size of this and it works much better. I do like the fact that it uses 4 AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable battery that inevitably is dead when you want to use the speaker.</text>

        <text>I read several of the reviews of this product, both five star and one star.  Decided to order to product, although some of the one star ratings made me a little anxious.  After receiving the product and charging it I found the following:  Total charging time for 2 1/2 hours is a necessity as outlined in the instruction manual.  A little long for my liking, but if it holds a charge for the stated times in the manual, it's worth the wait.  Pairing to my iPhone was a breeze.  Just turn on the iKross, go the setting on the iPhone and turn on bluetooth.  Pairing take about 45 seconds w/o any problems.  Once installed in the vehicle, just turn on the iKross unit and pairing occurs automatically.  Reception has been good for me depending on the strength of signal from the cell towers.  No dropped calls as of yet.  For me, the volume is good as long as the windows are up.  So, long story short, I am pleased thus far.  On the negative side, the visor holder for this unit needs improvement.  My visor is thick and the slip on holder for the iKross won't stay.  I had to reposition the unit to the plastic pullout on my visor.  I don't like that as the unit isn't anchored as solidly as it could and should be.  The magnets that attach the unit to the visor holder appear adequate as long as one isn't over zealous when pressing the on/off switches and volume controls.  All in all, I'm pleased with this product, except for the visor attachment.  Will follow up if issues arise.</text>

        <text>So we got this today, and before even getting the chance to open the Amazon box, it was damaged.  We opened the Amazon box to find the product's packaging also damaged.  Not looking good.  We opened the item and looked at the included accessories, and read the instructions, and turns out you must charge this for 2.5 hours first.  No problem, except that there is no wall outlet.  I hadn't noticed that from the images.  So I have to start the car and leave it charge for 2.5 hours?  I'm rarely in the car that long unless I'm on a trip.  That's crazy????  Not happy.</text>

        <text>UPDATE: April '12: mine stopped charging the phone all together, which is a real bummer since I depended on for long car trips. Before that, it was a total must have for me.I love my iphone, but don't always love the AT&amp;T; service, which is shoddy and often drops calls. Effortless to set up with very good directions, and already I've had less dropped calls and more bars when I'm traveling. This is going to be the perfect solution when it works with the model car you have, its definitely a 5 star product in that respect. I struggled with the star rating because though it's not the right setup in my car, it would greatly help those who have a crappy signal.The 3 stars is strictly because I have a Jeep 4 door Wrangler. 2 big reasons for the star downgrade:- The 3 mounting options(2 sticky ones and a vent mount) are limited and don't work in my jeep. The vent mount does not work with my vents which are very wide and long, so the clip doesn't extend enough to grip it in the back. Also, I don't have any dash part near me to affix the glue sticky mounts. The only real place to put it makes it awkward to access my iphone. Plus I don't like the idea of permanently affixing anything to my car, especially since it becomes a gooey mess in the summer. So this sat in my cup holder until I found a suction mount online that works with the back of the cradle so now I have a pretty sweet setup. If you're interesting in getting one, leave me a comment and I'll send the link of the one I'm using.- The antenna to boost the signal is made to magnetically mount to the top of your car. That's great...if the top of your car is metal. My jeep hardtop is fiberglass and the soft top is fabric. So I had to figure out a solution. Thankfully the wire that leads from the cradle to the antenna is really long. So I was able to snake it all the way to the rear and I mounted the antenna underneath the tire on the back. Not perfect, but it's still boosting the signal and working as if it were on the top. Its hidden for the most part as well by the tire, so hopefully I won't have any strangers fiddling with it.Otherwise, the mount easily fits my iphone 3GS with my cover on it. It charges it, and holds it snugly. The power jack has a great on and off switch so you don't necessarily need to unplug it when not in use. Just push the button and you're set.All in all, really a nice product and a great buy if you have the right vehicle.</text>

        <text>Let's get right to the point. This is only a signal booster and nothing more. It works as it should to boost your signal, acting as an amplifier to a standard weaker antenna that is embedded in your phone. However, there are diminishing returns, such as when you are in a heavily wooded area, on a mountain, at the bottom of a mountain, any higher elevation area, or in places with deplorable reception to begin with.You are looking at this product because, I am guessing, you need better reception in certain areas, mainly when you are driving. This does work in boosting your signal and does it well. So the first thing that should be answered in this review to those contemplating a purchase is that: It does do what it is supposed to. Just do not expect miracles if the circumstances do not allow them so--as I stated above.As far as installation, it is easy to set up. Just running a few wires down through the seats, and plopping an antenna on top of the roof of your car. Very self explanatory and detailed. Anyone should be able to do that.When sitting in your car, it might come off as bulky if you have a small compact (such as a civic, corolla etc.). With the latter I would go even so far as to say that it may get in the way. However, I am sure if that was the only obstacle it would not be that much of a problem. Just letting you know it is almost twice as big as the Iphone itself, without the sleek thinness, if you know what I mean. So if you have a gps hanging around, you choose to purchase this, and your car is a small compact, your interior may start to become just a little crowded.If you need a signal booster, this will do just that. It will not work in areas that present problems for receptions in general, but will certainly give you a much better equipped antenna than what is already in the Iphone. It is quick and easy to install, just make sure you interior is not already crowded as this could be an unwelcomed addition.</text>

        <text>I have followed the directions as given and my iPhone reception is reasonable. Has it improved with the use of this device? I cannot really claim to have seen a difference. I still get an occasional dropped call, or show minimal reception bars even when the phone is in the cradle. I have used my phone both with and without the device, and while not observing _strict_ scientific method, I am not sure that I notice a difference either way.My test was performed in the car on the I-5 between Sacramento, CA and Los Angeles, CA, at points as desolate as points running through Arizona or New Mexico.The good things I like about the booster are all of the ergonomic form factors - fits my phone even in the case, charges the phone while cradled. On the flip side - I cannot connect my phone to my car stereo via the USB port and have to use the Aux input which limits my ability to control the phone via the stereo, yet another thing to plug into my single car electrical outlet (leaves me wondering where to plug in my GPS).Ultimately, it seems my cell reception varies with and without the device and my benefit from using this signal booster is questionable, enough so that I would not recommend that anyone spend the $200+ unless they are in dire need of a signal booster.

        <text>This installs easy and work very well in rural areas.  But you definetely have no use for this in largers cities!  The one negative is the antenna cable may be a bit on the short side for some cars, and I keep thinking it's going to fall off one of these days.</text>

        <text>While I spend most of my time within the city limits there are times I venture out to the coast or to the mountains and find my signal to be less than fantastic. This iBooster does boost the signal significantly and I can get service in areas I hadn't. Unfortunately there are a number of quirks that you have to deal with to get this thing to work. First off all it does take some time to install, you've got a separate antenna and cables you have to run. It's not trivial to set it all up and get it mounted.My iPhone also barks that it's not a supported device, so I keep having to dismiss the messages every time I plug in my iphone.  But I do really like that it's wide enough to fit my iPhone with its protective case on it. Many devices don't support this and it's a nice touch.The most unfortunate thing is that no matter how strong your reception is there's nothing you can do when AT&amp;T;'s has service issues. I had a couple dropped calls from within the city and I know that this iBooster  was doing its job.If you live out in a rural area and signal is a major issue, the iBooster is going to be a godsend.  It may be overkill and too much hassle for people who are more city bound.</text>

        <text>When the opportunity arose to review this product I jumped at it.  My husband and I are both iPhone users and while I generally don't have many issues with not being able to get a signal [unless I'm in a store] he encounters several dead zones on his way to and from work.  The dead zones are an annoyance when we're talking during his commute home, but that annoyance becomes a bigger problem when it means dropped calls in the middle of on the go conference calls.  I figured it was worth a shot to see if the iBooster could really increase his cell phone signal.To test out this device my husband set it up and then called and talked to me when he got to the areas near where his phone always loses it signal.  The end result was the device worked as advertised.  In two out of the three dead zones the signal held up well at full strength (5 bars) with no digitized sounds.  In the third dead zone, the phone showed a solid connection but my voice came through digitized and unclear.My husband had a few complaints about the practicality of this device.  His first issue was with the design of the device.  It creates interference with voice activated dialing since the microphone is at the bottom of the phone and is obstructed by the housing of the iBooster.  He had to hold the device and phone up to his face and yell at it in order to get the voice activated dialing to work.  He took issue with the claim that the iBooster is compatible with most iPhone cases.  He has a very slim case and he had to remove the case to mount the phone in the iBooster.  He found this annoying.  His next complaint is that the iBooster will only charge your phone and boost the signal.  That's great if all you do is talk on your iPhone, but for those of us who use our iPhones to listen to music or podcasts in the car, the iBooster has very limited use.  He felt the iBooster would be awesome if it had an FM tuner.  The single mode of operation make this product seem illogical for the average user given the price.  He also noted that the back of the iBooster gets very hot.The bottom line is this product does what's it's supposed to do, but it has some quirks.  This device would make the most sense for someone who spends a lot of time in their car while conducting business on their phone.</text>

        <text>First, some notes on the booster:It seems to do what it says. There's no way for me to measure, but it may very well boost your signal by 20 times. That's amazing.Also, my favorite feature is the "pass-through" connector on the cradle, allowing you to use other accessories while it's boosting &amp; charging (i.e., so I can plug it into my radio &amp; listen to my music WHILE it's boosting and charging).And, set-up and instructions are easy to follow.Regarding the error message: "Device is not supported". This is a common error message with 3rd party accessories, and not unique to this product. Also, the error message shouldn't hinder the function of the booster. Part of the problem is Apple intentionally makes it difficult to use gear from 3rd parties - SHAME ON YOU, Apple.So you never know if it's a real problem, or Apple just being greedy. Every time I see messages like this, I think of companies like Apple being the jealous ex-girlfriend, who doesn't like you hooking up with new brands of accessories!!!Anyway, 4 things on the unsupported device message: (1) Friends who use phones not purchased directly from their provider (i.e., an unlocked phone) get this message much more often. If this is the case, you may need to restore it again from scratch if your accessories are not working.(2) Make sure the connection is good (no debris, dust, etc).(3) Sometimes the message just goes away after a few minutes. Please note that if your phone is not charging while in the cradle, it *may* start charging if/when the error message goes away. (Anyone have a comment on this???)(4) If the connection is good, and it's an original phone, try this: When the error appears, turn OFF your iPhone while it's docked, and turning it back on. Often times (maybe 50-75% of the time), when the device reboots with the new accessory attached, it will not give you the message.Wish I had a 100% fix on this, but like I said, Apple apparently does this on purpose so reliable workarounds are not always possible. Nonetheless, I hope this was helpful. Please leave comments if you have any new ideas...and enjoy your boosted signal!</text>

        <text>There are several spots on the commute to/from work that we always have problems with dropped calls and it's in an area where if you break down, the next person might not come along for a bit so I always worried about our safety.  This product has eased my worries and it really does work in boosting the signal.  We tested it in those areas and it reliably boosted it where we could make calls without a problem.  For that peace of mind alone I give it 5 stars.  The set-up was easy, with clear and concise instructions and I appreciate that, I'm a person who admittedly has no patience for detailed, long-winded instructions.

        <text>Both my husband &amp; I are using AT&amp;T; - I'm on an iPhone, he is not. He has resisted getting an iPhone because until he &amp; I met a couple of years ago, he only experienced dropped calls very rarely. Whenever we are speaking, or if I am speaking to anyone else on my iPhone, I lose the signal 3 times minimum and have to re-dial. This is a notorious problem with the iPhone that has only experienced minor improvement after some software updates.I frequently lose signal strength in some areas in the greater DFW metroplex. I was anxious to try out this kit that could make my phone more accessible (ie, not flopping around in the passenger seat or next to the emergency brake) and reduced dropped calls.There was an adhesive mount and A/C vent mount included. I have learned from experience never to put adhesive on my dash. I live in Texas and when the sun comes out in the summer, volcanos send sympathy cards to the asphalt! Any adhesive will turn runny, sticky and unable to hold onto anything with more weight than a postage stamp when your car sits out in the hot Texas sun. I've always been strongly mechanically inclined and had to fiddle with the A/C vent mount for 45 minutes before I finally threw my hands up in the air with modest defeat. I decided it was ok for it to hang from one side and bounce around - if only I could get better signal strength.In fairness, I have a new VW Beetle... they are known for their large sloping dashes, steep angled windshields, etc. There may be no good way to mount this in a Beetle with a 'universal' kit.Sliding the phone in the cradle and getting it to properly mount on the 30 pin connector is not a one-handed procedure. I had to take the mount off the A/C vent and pull on the plastic in the front to get my iPhone 3GS to finally properly seat onto that connector. That was about as frustrating as trying to get the cradle onto the vent, then trying to remove it.I watched the video, followed the instructions step by step and mounted the magnetic antenna. I was disappointed to see that the antenna that came with the kit was wired so that no matter how you mounted the antenna, there was access to a cable that someone could vandalize. When you live in a city like Dallas, people cut such cords just for fun. I ran the lengthy (nice length for routing along door/floor trim) cable under my seat and up the side of the interior of the Beetle and ran the cord out the top of the hatch back where the rubber trim protected the cord from being crimped. The small antenna has a strong magnet - strong enough to keep that thing mounted even in strong winds. I sometimes go to the mall or shopping and will put a jacket on top of things I don't want people getting tempted by. A cunning thief need only tug on the antenna if they notice the cord, to pull the cradle along the car interior to move the jacket out of the way to see what is underneath. No, they won't be able to just pull the whole kit-n-kaboodle out of the car without breaking some glass, but it is something to think about. The kit provides a list of available antennas, including a glass mount which would avoid such problems, that can be acquired for the kit. It' s shame that a glass mount antenna was not included from the get-go.After going through all of this frustration, I drove around and made some calls. In areas where I know I typically get less than 5 bars, I saw no improvement. I'd unseat the phone and pop it into the cradle - the familiar charging beep could be heard and the battery symbol showed a lightning bolt through it - it was seated - antenna was securely attached, cable was not crimped - and no improvement. Not only was there no improvement, two people I called said that there was an echo when I talked. The minute I'd pull the phone out of the cradle, the echo would go away. I was using the Apple-provided earbuds, not the speaker phone.During the demo video, the viewer can clearly see an improvement in signal strength. I saw no such improvement. This could have to do with the car and the area in which I live, but I know I was underwhelmed either way and frustrated with the difficulty in getting my iPhone in the cradle (this is without a case on the phone, of course) and trying to mount the cradle in my car.</text>

It provides both a direct (in cradle) signal boost, but also will boost many GSM AT&amp;T; phones if you are within a few feet of the cradle. Sweet!  My only disappointment is the antenna cable is not long enough to run to the trunk area of most mid size cars.  I don't really want it on the top of my car or my hood, so I have made it an emergency repeater... see bottom of review.Pros:* VERY well made* Multiple mounting options* Provides a signal boost to many AT&amp;T; phones, not just iPhone, if you are close proximity to the cradle. (This feature is mentioned in the manual)* Pass through charger as well as switch on the 12V plug are nice options!Cons:* Antenna cable is too short for trunk mounting on mid size cars.Since I don't want to have this antenna sticking up on my car roof, and AT&amp;T; coverage is not too bad in my area, I have actually re-purposed this to provide strong AT&amp;T; signal to my emergency AT&amp;T; cell phone down in my underground storm shelter.  It works great down there and provides me with 5 bars underground on a Nokia phone!I highly recommend if you don't mind the roof mounting of the antenna.  (You could probably purchase an extension somewhere to take it all the way to the trunk.)</text>

        <text>While this product does deliver on its promise to boost the signal somewhat, it does not guarantee that you will have fewer dropped calls on the AT&amp;T; network.  AT&amp;T; is overloaded with iPhones and other 3g devices and thus we are facing an overwhelmed network...which is why we drop calls.  A better signal you will get with this product..but it will not help you with dropping calls.  How can I confirm this?Number one - I have an iPhone 3GSNumber two - I have a Blackberry Bold 9700Both 3G devices.The signal strength around my home is a bit on the weak side and thus this product does improve reception...but the amount of calls I drop remains the same after multiple weeks of testing.I am giving it 3 stars due to the increase in strength but it does not help you avoid call drops.Hope this helps</text>

        <text>Well definitely this is one of the slimmest silicone iPhone covers I've ever seen. And despite of that, it does provide "OK" protection (I've drop it a couple of times now with no impact on chassis). However I kept wondering if the sellers have two models, a quality one and a sloppy one, because many reviewers have praise the quality of this skin case. Unfortunately mine is definitely sloppy. The cut outs are not even, they don't fit correctly at the camera side nor the silencing lever. For me the worst part is that, since it fails to provide a firm grab, it moves around to much to the point that I'm always pushing out the screen protector (which comes with the skin case and is in fact pretty good) from the edges of the phone .Honestly I was expecting a little more even despite the price.</text>

        <text>Hi i just recently purchased this case and love it. Its not exactly the same color as the picture, i noticed that it is a lighter green (kinda looks like it glows in the dark) &amp; is see thru but i actually love it because its different and the apple logo on the back of the phone is noticeable through the phone case.

        <text>When I got my 3GS iPhone 19 months ago, I made the mistake of purchasing an overpriced, metal cover from the AT&amp;T; store. Within only a few months, the paint on it started wearing off in ugly patches, and after only a few drops of my phone, pieces started falling off it. I put off buying another case far too long because I made another wrong assumption--that I couldn't find an outstanding cover that I really like, which will not crack, break or lose its color, at a reasonable price right here on Amazon. Instead, within minutes of searching for a cover, I found this one, which is exactly what I wish I had been savvy enough to purchase from the beginning.I'm a fan of silicone for kitchen utensils, and based on that experience, I am confident that this case will not break if I drop my phone, and provide much better cushioning protection than cases of metal or cloth. Silicone also has terrific water-repellent properties.This case comes in a wide range of colors, something for every possible taste. I purchased red, and it is an extremely nice shade, deep and rich. The case also has a decorative pattern traced in it, which looks like the swirling lines in a piece of wood and is quite attractive. The feel of the silicone in my hand is the best part of all for me. It is smooth and soft and warms to the hand, with no rough edges or cold feel that my metal case had. It's almost as much fun to hold in my palm as my siliconestress ball.Another advantage is that this is a one-piece case that slips over my phone easily. It fits my phone perfectly, adding no bulk at all.</text>

        <text>I checked to make sure I ordered the correct iPhone case before ordering, just to make sure since I ordered it expedited mail, which in reality cost more than the item itself. My iPhone case broke and I can't afford to replace a cell phone so I needed a case immediately. This case is slippery when you put it in. It covers up the volume buttons, although it does have little "bumps" where the volume buttons are but they are slippery. The cover also partially covers up the camera lense. It is impossible to take a photograph with the case on. Truly, this item is total garbage. I should have spent the extra money for the Otterbox. Mine last for over a year and held up to everything!</text>

        <text>This phone case is decent quality for the price, I do feel it protects my phone when I drop it. The problem is that it stretches out when pulling in and out of pockets, as well as turning the pocket inside out (classy look). It also traps all the lint and dust, something to know in advance. The wood design is pretty but once it stretches out my phone slides right out and its purpose is then null. But it's cheap enough that you can easily buy another one, or two at once.</text>

        <text>I bought this as a backup battery for myBlackBerry Bold 9650 Phone (Verizon Wireless)for my trip to Hungary.  Though the label on the battery says it is for the Storm, both the Bold and the Storm uses the same battery, so no worries.  It shipped in a small plastic bag (with two other batteries I purchased for other phones), and the batteries were in a padded larger envelope.  At first, I was not sure what to expect from this battery.  However, I was not dissapointed.  After charging overnight, the battery held a charge under a normal day's use using the phone for calls, texting, music, and data-intensive web browsing and email.  The battery indicator showed I only used half the battery's charge (which is on par with the original battery).  I switched batteries when the charge ran empty, and after using it for several weeks (alternating batteries after complete discharge) I cannot tell which battery was the original and which is the backup.  I labelled the backup battery (this review) with "OEM" to discern the difference.A colleague lent me herBlackBerry Micro USB Extra Battery Charger (D-Series), which is a great add-on to charge (and carry) a spare battery.  It seems highly recommended to completely discharge a battery prior to recharging (though this can be debated).  Having this spare charger will allow me to use up all the battery power of one battery, pop on the fully-charged battery, and charge the spent battery.I did not encounter any problems reported by other reviewers.  The vendor is BTO, Inc.  For 25% (or less) the cost of retail, I would buy this battery and other batteries from this seller again.(BTW, the other two batteries were also functional and able to hold a charge.  I replaced the original batteries of two other phones that could not even hold a charge for half a day.  With these replacement batteries, they hold a charge for several days.)</text>

Some have commented that pink line means the battery has been exposed to water, but I don't think so because my original battery had the pink line since it was brand new.  Regardless, the battery works and at the price I am completely satisfied with it.</text>

I wanted to buy more to store my two older bluetooth headsets and chargers in.I Can fit my Blackberry Sync cable in,  my Motorola bluetooth headset and dock for it (not the charging wire though,  but can use blackberry sync cable to charge through laptop),  can also fit my apple earbuds in, a few SD cards,  and my Square swiper.  thats a lot for a case this small.

        <text>I've had this phone for about a year and generally like it.  I bought it to be able to access the internet and check my online calendar and email.  As a voice and text phone, it functions quite well.  However the internet and "smartphone" features are pretty weak.The default browser on the phone is just "ok", but doesn't support the necessary security protocols to be able to access my webmail.  It also has a bunch of super annoying "locked" bookmarks, which you can't modify or remove.  I bought the darned phone, shouldn't I at least be able to set up bookmarks in my own browser?  Regardless, what I would highly recommend doing is installing Opera Mini (works great) and using that instead of the default browser.  My webmail works like a charm on that.Along the same lines, there are a bunch of paid services (GPS, weather, games) which are *locked* within the menus.  The phone will allow you to remove the free services if you like, but the ones are subscription based cannot be modified.  It's as if they are saying "pleeeeaassee buy this service".  One time I accidentally activated AT&amp;T; navigator by forgetting to lock the phone when I put it in my pocket.  Of course there was no way to opt-out through the phone, so I had to call AT&amp;T; to get it taken care of.Physically the phone is built well, with a robust slide out keyboard.  It really snaps in and out of place very firmly and feel substantial.  After one year it's just as structurally sound as it was on day one - and yes I've dropped it a couple times.  Like most phones, the shiny front and plastic backing will become scratched over time.  Reception is generally good and dropped calls are rare.So overall this is a nice phone, but I wouldn't qualify it as a "smartphone".  If you need serious internet or multimedia features, buy and Android or iPhone.</text>

        <text>I have mine on for over 3 months now, don't really have issues with it and didn't have to replace my first screen protector yet! It was fairly easy to apply however the microfiber cloth that comes with it is useless so use one of your own even when you need to clean your touch screen. Using a better soft cloth will definitely make your protector go further!.Once your touch screen is clean use the same soft cloth to apply the protector. Don't apply the protector all at once, smooth out a small surface area with the soft cloth as you apply a small section at a time. I managed it with just the one teeny weeny bubble  on my first try and managed just the one scratch since. Don't know why others are having a problem. I guess you have to take care of your phone to avoid such issues!It's helped me and definitely served the purpose. I also bought the silicon case from the same vendor (also a good buy).

        <text>The price is great. You get three screen protectors. But for some reason when you place the screen protector on your phone it creates air bubbles, which is very hard to remove. I tried many ways to remove the air bubbles, but the air bubbles won't go away. That gives the screen a bad look. The product is made of very thin material so its almost not noticeable which is the good thing about this screen protector.

It comes with a pre-installation screen cleaner and easy to grasp tabs to keep your protector fingerprint free.Then to top it off, it's lasted longer than any of the others!

    </sentence>
    <sentence id="9601">
        <text>I've used Powersupport Crystal Film on my various ipods and iphones over the past 5 years.  I've also strayed twice and used different brands (Zagg - more expensive, and some other, much cheaper brand).  Crystal Film works best, is not difficult to apply, and once you get it on, it will stay on and look like brand new for years, literally.  On iphone and ipod touch, the film is so invisible and causes absolutely no reduction in video or image quality or clarity.  The only way you can tell it's on is that the edges of the film (which extend to the very edge of the glass screen) are SLIGHTLY visible. But they line up perfectly with the edge of the screen, so they really do not look out of place.Installation is not difficult if you know what you're doing.  I strongly recommend you take 60 seconds and watch the video at the powersupport website - your application will be easier if you see it done and can visualize the process.Work on a dust-free table top with plenty of space.  For best results, have the following items handy:  scotch tape, microfiber cloth (such as what you'd use to clean the lenses of your glasses), and a bottle of clear liquid lens cleaner (a few bucks at any lenscrafter or eyeglass store).  (by the way, this eyeglass cleaner and microfiber cloth is really the best way to clean the display of your touch-screen devices and your laptop computer)First, clean the screen of your device by spraying the eyeglass cleaner on it and wiping it dry with the microfiber cloth.  Inspect for remaining dust by holding it at various angles and looking closely.  If needed, wipe again with the microfiber.Then, use the included pre-installation film - it's basically just a big white piece of tape, which you put on your device's screen and then pull off.  It's purpose is to remove any remaining fine dust.Then apply the crystal film.  It has a backing which you gradually remove as you apply.  Before applying, line the hole in the crystal film up with the button of your iphone, then align the edges of the crystal film with the edges of the glass display.  Gradually remove the film and apply, from the side with the button to the other side.Use your microfiber to gently rub any bubbles toward the nearest edge, or lift up a corner of the film just until the bubble comes out, then gently let the film back down.The scotch tape is useful for 2 things.  First, if you get the film on and it's not quite lined up perfectly - don't freak out - this can be fixed.  Put a small piece of tape on the corner with part of it hanging off to use as a handle, and lift the film off from the corner with one hand, use the other hand to hold the film as it comes off by the edges and to gently reposition it.The other reason to have the tape handy is in case a spec of dust gets trapped in the film.  Use one piece of tape to lift up the film partway, starting from the corner nearest the spec of dust.  Use a second piece of tape to remove the dust from the underside of the film (sticky side of tape touches the film to pull the dust off it).All this is much easier than it sounds.  It takes maybe 10 minutes.  Maybe less.  It's good to move quickly from each step to the next.  The longer you wait, the greater the chance of piece of dust floating in the air will land on the film or on the device before you finish applying the film.Once the film is on, there is no drying time needed.  You can use your device immediately.The film provides excellent protection and is extremely clear.  Like I said, you really can't tell it's on.I also tried a Zagg shield (another brand of film) because I got a new ipod touch and wanted to protect it right away, and the local best buy had zagg but no store nearby had crystal film.  The Zagg film is stronger - it's hard to poke a hold through it.  On the other hand, it feels slightly gummy on the device and clarity is a problem - you can definitely tell it's on, images and video just do not look as crisp as with the crystal film or with nothing at all.  This is not because I did a poor job installing it - in fact, I paid best buy to install it, and the person who did the installation has done this dozens of times and was quite good.  But after 4 days, I took it back, convinced the manager to refund both the purchase price and installation fee.  I could have saved myself from this hassle if I had just ordered the crystal film in the first place and waited for it to arrive.Of course, the film only protects the display, not the back or the edges of the device.  You'll surely want a case for overall protection.  If the case you buy comes with screen film, I suggest using crystal film instead.  It really is the best, and you're spending a lot of money on your device, it's worth spending a little more to protect the gorgeous display while completely preserving its clarity.</text>

        <text>I've tried every mainstream brand of screen protector for iPhone that I could find and by far this is the best product in my opinion.  It has the fewest air bubbles and lint problems during application, it fits most perfectly compared to other brands, and holds up the best over time.I'm not kidding when I'm saying I'm a perfectionist when it comes to screen protectors for the iPhone.  If I apply one and it isn't perfect and I cannot recover it, I'll peel that puppy right back off immediately and move on to another. I've gone through Kroo, Case Mate, Krypton and other "semi-nonames" out there.Power Support is the only brand I can rely on to be top notch quality, every time.There are a couple issues I have with most other brands...1.  Most other brands are cut just a little too large for me.  I want a perfect seal around the edges.  Other brands with a larger cut size allow lint to sneak in and make it almost impossible to center.  This brand is cut perfectly to my liking as far as size goes.2.  Other brands are too "sticky" and attract lint even when applying it. It's almost impossible to get the lint off of other brands during application. This brand, once you set the center  of the protector on the screen, nearly applies itself top to bottom once you let loose of it. Not much work to get a really good application.3.  Getting air bubbles out on other brands tends to stretch the protector, and once you've stretched it it's done-- it won't fit properly again. This brand doesn't stretch.Finally, I like the texture and touch accuracy that I get with this brand.  Some other brands seem to dull or degrade the touch sensitivity a bit or make a strange texture that is difficult to slide around on.  This brand is the best of all worlds.In summary,  I have tried and retried a LOT of brands, big names, no names, etc. This is still my first an only choice when I want the chance for a "perfect" application to the point that most people cannot even tell there is a screen protector on the phone.</text>

        <text>Read the instructions very carefully and approach the installation like brain surgery. Lint and bubbles are major threats to a clear picture and it is very difficult to avoid them.

        <text>Purchased these as a Mothers Day gift to my wife while I attempt to repair the failing jack on the higher-end Sk*******y pair she had been using for the last couple years.  She had also purchased a pair of bargain-grade Sk******y buds when she once lost said high-end pair about a year ago, so she fished those out prior to the weekend and used those (first) as a stand-in.  I tried them out and, while they were comfortable, they sounded gawd-awful.  Like one-star awful.  Way to use your premium name to push crappy product, Sk******y.So, wife having been successfully courted and conditioned by brand name, we ALL had low expectations for a less-than-one-Jackson pair of toy-looking "M&amp;M;" earbuds.  At worst, the novelty of packaging and color of the buds would suffice for a Mothers Day gag gift, though I bought these on the high recommendations of the 100+ reviewers here on Amazon.Wife came up to me, grinning ear-to-ear.  "Have you heard these?", she stammered.  I put 'em in.  Better-than-decent highs, tempered midrange, nearly flat bass - holy cow, these things sound ABSOLUTELY GREAT!  And I'm not talking great-for-what-I-paid great, I mean Maxell-got-away-with-WHAT? sort of great.  "OK, hon, you're not going to believe how much I paid for them," I was coy.

        <text>Although "earbuds" (in reference to headphones) are a general classification, I consider there to be two different types of earbuds.  The first are earbud heaphones that just fit just over your ear canal where the speaker is just on top of the canal.  The second type of earbud headphones are the noise isolating type where the actual speaker is inserted into the ear canal with a surrounding foam or rubber tip that serves 2 functions. The first is a slight pressure to allow it to stay in place and the second is to seal the ear and isolate noise (both from the headphone &amp; outside) at the same time.These M&amp;M; earbuds are the latter type (noise isolating) although they don't advertise it. Practically, all earbuds with the canal tips are considered noise isolating to a certain degree (depends on the snugness of the tips themselves). Noise-isolating (in-ear) phones use a passive system, simply sealing the ear. To the 30db or so reduction in all outside noise this alone provides, sound is enhanced by being sent directly into the ear. The ratio of music to outside noise in the ear is, therefore, extremely high They need no batteries, are lightweight and compact.I initially purchased these exact same earbuds from the M&amp;M; Store at Times Square in NYC for the exact same price that's listed on Amazon. These are made by Maxell, so you know that at least some national brand name with a decent reputation is attached to these earbuds. Unfortunately I lost that 1st set and found the exact same model replacement on Amazon.Physically, these look like oversized M&amp;Ms; which snugly fit in your ear. Kids will like it because kids generally like that sort of thing. A bonus with these is that they come with two tips (regular and small). The regular ones are the ones that are already installed and for those of you that have smaller ear canals can swap them out with the others.Because of the noise-isolating feature, these earphones can be very loud if you want them to be. The sound quality given the price is very good as well. The highs aren't tinny and there is some bass response, which is nice. Don't expect these to sound like the $80+ earbuds you see out there by Klipsch (Klipsch IMAGE S4 In-Ear Enhanced Bass Noise-Isolating Headphones (Black)) but if you need some earbuds that won't break the bank, what to represent your love for M&amp;M;'s, and want to get the job done, consider these for under $8.</text>

        <text>Earphones with an M&amp;M;'s theme, are kind of a cute idea.  If you are looking for some economic earphones, for young children who are more concerned with appearance, rather than sound quality, you might consider them.If you want a decent sound however, save your money and look elsewhere.  The sound quality is muddy, with a heavy bias on the low end.  High frequencies are not reproduced well, and for regular music, it can even be hard to make out some vocals.  In addition, the build quality appears to be on the cheap side, in some areas.  The cord is very thin, and probably more prone to breakage.Perhaps these earphones are intended for small children, as out of the package they come with tiny silicone earbuds attached, that are too small for most adults to wear.  Larger sized earbuds are included (loose inside package, so don't lose them).  To install the larger earbud, you first need to remove the tiny one (don't tear it!).  There is a technique to attaching the larger earbud.  Turn it inside out, and attach it to the stem with the speaker, then push the edges down to get it back to the proper shape.  With the large sized earbuds installed, you can get a snug fit, but probably not one that cuts out too much of the ambient sound.These phones may look cool to some, but that's about the only positive.  They do not reproduce sound well, and may not last for very long.  The fit is comfortable, but if the earbuds get torn, you will probably need to buy new earphones, as a spare set of earbuds is not provided.If you are looking for earphones in the same price range, that sound better, do a better job of cutting out ambient sound, are available in a variety of colors, and have a spare set of earpads, take a look at JVC's Marshmallow series.</text>

        <text>Item was as described, and the plastic is reasonably hard, but the plastic is not strong enough to do what I needed it for.  I needed to open an iPod touch.  It may work in other situations, but not what I bought it for.  The product is not defective, it is just not up to the task that I had envisioned it for.I would suggest you get the iSesamo metal case opener (which I also bought) which works a lot better.  The metal does not bend as much as I thought it would, even thought the blade is thin.</text>

        <text>Nice non marring tool. This tool is somewhat thick for the initial opening of a tablet or cell phone. It is nice to use once you have the device cracked open to run around the edges and separate the case adhesive. It is very comfortable to hold and use. It is thicker and larger than a guitar pick. I'm going to my local music store to buy a coupe of heavy grade guitar picks to try out as guitar picks come in a variety of grades and shapes.This tool is also soft so don't expect it to last a long time. It works as intended for a fair price.</text>

        <text>I didn't buy these to take a a cell phone apart, but rather a Tablet PC and they were worked flawlessly. I couldn't be happier with the result. No scratches on the tablet and not one single broken part as I used these to slowly pry around the edge of the aluminum case to split it from its plastic underside. I upgraded the tablet with an SSD Drive to get more performance and battery life and could not have done as good a job without this purchase for sure. Worth far more than the sales price when you calculate not breaking and replacing parts due to improperly dismantling a project as delicate as a small piece of electronics that was never really meant to be opened by the consumer.</text>

        <text>I've done business with these guys before, and I was delighted to find they had the best price for the actual Samsung battery that works in my latest technology Nexus S with Google Android phone. I put one in the phone to charge and one in an external charger. Both accepted a full charge in pretty much the same fashion as the original battery and I can make it through about any day without having to find a power outlet. I haven't seen a smartphone yet that will go all day without at least one stop by the charger, but with the higher resolution devices, 60% or more of the power is eaten up by the screen. My latest figure was 72% in a 24 hour period. Must have watched a lot of videos or photos that day. In any event, having the spares definitely gets me through.</text>

        <text>These are really inexpensive factory refurbished batteries. They differ from regular Samsung batteries in that they seem to have an "LZ" instead of a fancy barcode on the back. I ordered a pair of these and when one was dead on arrival, the seller quickly sent me another one.One thing to note is that some of these aren't pre-charged, so you'll need to have your phone off when you initially charge them up if you're charging by plugging it in over USB to a computer or have a dedicated standalone charger. Otherwise, the current draw to charge the battery is too much to keep the phone on and it'll die.These things are a great deal at the price and have the same life as the battery that came with my phone.

    <sentence id="9671">
        <text>I'm quite pleased with this snap-on case.  The blue is very vibrant, and resists smudges and scuffs fairly well.  The rubberized feel is very subtle - enough to prevent it from skidding across a table, but not enough that it's hard to pull out of a pocket.  Everything lines up well with my Virgin Mobile Rumor 2, though there is no hole for the status light (a good thing, in my opinion) and I did have to trim a tiny amount of excess plastic from the underside of the face place so the phone would slide open more-easily.  It works with the screen protector film I'm using.  All the buttons and ports are still easily accessible.  I haven't used the included belt clip, but it felt decent in quality, and the instructions seemed simple enough.  Another note, the case itself didn't come with instructions, though it's innately simple to install without them.  The plastic used isn't the most robust feeling, and might not stand up to a lot of abuse, but it's definitely good quality for the low price.In all, I felt I definitely got more than my money's worth with this blue case.  It fulfills my modest requirements, and exceeds my expectations in appearance.  I think it's an exceptional value, for shoppers on a budget.--- Sept. 2011 update --- I've had this snap-on case on my Virgin Mobile Rumor 2 for many months now, and it's still in excellent shape.  It has survived day-in day-out in my tool pocket, persistent handling, having been dropped a few times, or moved around a bunch on my nightstand or desktop.  The finish is still nice, with almost no signs of wear, except for a small scratch on one corner.  The case still fits snug on both sides of the phone.  I'm definitely pleased with this purchase.</text>

        <text>After my wife got a shiny new car last year with Bluetooth, I found myself longing to ride in her car more and more often just so that I would have the convenience of hands free cell phone usage!  I had a Jabra JX10 Bluetooth earpiece from years back but found that it was not loud enough to compete with the enhanced exhaust and 13"-wide rear tires of my sports car.  Having been pleased with Jabra in the past, I naturally looked at their offerings first and decided upon the very reasonably priced SP200.The unit was as easy to pair with my phone (a Palm Pre) as any other Bluetooth headset and the volume is so loud that I can hear everyone just fine even if I'm roaring down the highway.  The noise canceling works so well that people often don't know I'm on Bluetooth and they never know that I'm in my loud sports car.  It's that good.A single charge lasts me several weeks (I don't talk that often while driving) and when it does get low, the handy LED reminder triggers me to drag it into my office with me and I simply attach it to the USB port on my computer (cable included) and let it charge for a couple of hours and I'm good to go again.Things I like about this headset:1) just tap the button and it wakes up from sleep mode and locks onto my phone2) have it paired with my wife's phone too (it can remember multiple phones)3) I don't have to turn it off- it magically goes to sleep after I've been away from the vehicle for awhile (15 minutes?)4) again, volume is ridiculously loud if you want it to be5) excellent clarity of my voice and their voice6) fairly stealthy up on the sunvisor- you forget it's there7) it's portable: sometimes I bring it in the house for conference calls8) crazy cheap for this level of qualityThings I don't like:1) I wish I didn't have to push anything to turn it on/wake it up.  Though I'm sure such a feature would be murderous on battery life.2) voice dial like my wife's car has would be awesome.  I think if I had a better phone, it could maybe use the phone's voice dial capability.  Sadly, I bought the godawful Palm Pre (never again).</text>

I was ready to slam the Storm against a brick wall. This battery was new in packaging when it arrived and mostly solved my troubles with the Storm. I ordered a second as a spare due to the low price, but really haven't needed it. My friends have all run to Droids and 4g, but I'm getting new life from a device I paid good money for.

        <text>I was very disappointed as I opened the package for this product.  There is very limited protection as the sides are completely open.  If you are looking for just protecting your screen, then this will work.  It will not stop anything from finding its way into the open sides.There is a very easy to use attachment screw that fastens into the tripod port on the bottom of the camera.  Once attached, you simply wrap the camera with the material and a velcro patch holds it in place.I have a small camera (FujiFilm EXR) and this wrap barely fits this camera.  The velcro has very little to attach itself to and if I do not stretch the material and wrap it extremely tight, then the velcro detaches.  Once when this happened, my camera fell out of my hands and onto the desk - if I was standing, the camera might have fallen to the floor.  There is no room to hold anything else in this wrap - this is not a substitute for a camera case to hold extra batteries, memory cards, or the charger.  The product description says that this product lends itself to easy removal of the battery and memory cards.  On my camera this is not true:  I would have to remove the entire wrap to get into the battery/memory card compartment.I take pictures everywhere I go and this product just gets in the way.  I generally carry the camera in my pants pocket and this would just add bulk.  I would still have to keep a small case handy for the other above mentioned accessories.I guess, I'm the minority so far, but I just don't see that this accomplishes anything and it adds a level of complication.</text>

        <text>I've always been a fan of Lowepro products and own several larger camera cases made by this company.This wrap is just as described: a snug neoprene cover around a camera.  The sides remain unprotected and dust will get in.My Canon A590 is on the large size for this wrap and I have to stretch the lining a bit to get the velcro to grasp, but once it takes hold it stays snug and remains so even in my pocket.  I can access my battery and memory chip in my camera with ease as the wrap is attached to the tripod mount.  For cameras with the tripod mount on the same side as the battery/memory chip opening, it might be more of a hassle to move aroound in.Ideally, this wrap would be perfect for slim point-and-shoot cameras with a width of less than an inch.  My Canon A590 is pushing it.  However, for protecting my LED screen and preventing scratches on the front, this is an ideal cover that adds little weight or girth to my camera and fits into a small purse, buttpack or backpack.  I don't plan on ever removing my wrap now.The wrap does not hinder my photography.As already mentioned, this wrap holds nothing but a camera.  If you need somthing for extra batteries or memory chips, you would need a case.  As a wrap, though, this little thing would add protection to your high-end digicam.This would be perfect for a Canon SD1100 and the like: a small, ultra-slim digicam.</text>

        <text>Maybe this product just isn't for me. As long as the lens is protected I'd rather let my camera get scratched up then deal with this thing hanging off of it. The D-Wrap screws into the tripod case on your camera and is sized for small point-and-shoot models. The attachment screw slides on a rail and the material is elastic so it should fit any camera of this class. It adds minimal bulk but doesn't protect the sides.The problem is what happens when you unwrap the case. Now you've got this foot long thing dangling from the bottom of your camara. It really gets in the way - especially if you turn the camera for a portrait shot.In practice, I found this too inconvenient to use. I'd rather have a case that fully protects it for travel and I'll put the camera in my pocket or a bag for ease of use during a day of sightseeing.</text>

        <text>I'm not a professional photographer; in fact I'm not even very good at taking snapshots--so thank goodness the camera designs are getting smarter and smarter--but I do carry my camera with me every day.And as someone who does nearly constantly have his camera handy but is not a pro I really appreciate this D-Wrap case, which is my second great camera case from LowePro.This is an especially good case for athletes like me because not only does it make the camera in the case as compact and convenient as carrying the camera without a case in my cycling jersey pocket or the Bento Box strapped to the top tube of my bicycle along with Clif Bars, money, and Advil for all day riding events, but it's also as easy to open and use the camera in an instant while providing adaquate protection from road vibration (which could damage both camera and an expensive bike frame), light rain, dirt, and perspiration.With this case, my camera is always at the ready, and yet it's in a case as well.I don't even carry a wallet--too bulky--but I carry my camera in this case.Since the camera is attached to the case where you would normally attach it to a tripod, you don't actually have to remove the camera from the case, then put the case in a pocket and hope you don't drop it and lose it somewhere.  With this case, I can get my camera out of its protective cover, use the camera, and put it back in the case all one-handed.Like I wrote above, this is my second LowePro case--the other one has zippers and pockets with space for the bare essentials--and only reinforces my recommendation for this brand of case exclusively.  I don't know of any other brand that provides professional level quality and performance to the general consumer at a general consumer price.BOTTOM LINE: Couldn't possibly be better or cheaper.  And the design looks great too.</text>

        <text>This camera "wrap" is just what I need.  My small camera case is more bulky so I end up having to wear it around my neck or put it in a backpack when I'm hiking or being a tourist.  This neoprene wrap completely surrounds, goes over the edges and is thick enough to provide ample protection for my Canon Elph.The base has a screw that attaches the wrap to the camera via the tripod hole.  Lowepro was even smart enough to put the screw through a heavy duty plastic bar so the screw can move, making this a wrap that will fit many cameras.  And the screw has a little popup handle so no screwdriver is necessary.It's simple to use.  Just unwrap &amp; let it hang below your camera.  It doesn't get in the way &amp; stays attached.The only improvement I would suggest is a little pocket to carry an extra memory chip.  Other than that; it's brilliant.</text>

        <text>The Lowepro D-Wrap is for cameras, but not much else. I used this wrap with myFujifilm FinePix F200EXRcamera and I felt it was not the right fit. The wrap did not close as well as it could unless I really pulled at the wrap to close it over (it stretches). The wrap does not protect your camera against dirt, water, sand, etc. due to the open areas on each side of the camera. But, also thanks to these open areas, the carrying lanyard sticks out and it is easy to carry your camera around.  The wrap does provide some padding for your camera.I was disappointed that the wrap did not fit myFlip MinoHD CamcorderorVado HD 8 GB Pocket Video Camcorder, 2nd Generation. The wrap does not adapt for any other type of video devices.Frankly, it takes less time to get the camera out of a generic camera case (1 second) than this wrap (2 seconds). [Tested with a stopwatch.]Also, there are no pockets in this wrap, so you cannot store SD cards or batteries.A camera bag/case is much better if you want to protect your camera from dirt and water. If you are looking for something less bulky, this is a good option.</text>

        <text>A very clever solution if you have a mini digital camera.  Super convenient as you don't have to remove the camera from the case. It's a wrap! Just unhook the Velcro, and you are ready for a snap.It works by utilizing the tripod socket under the camera. It doesn't matter if socket is at the center or off center, it is very easy to adjust. After making sure that the camera is tightly secured, then you wrap it like a burrito :) It will be open to the sides, but it will still be completely protected as the material extends beyond the length of the camera.One disadvantage is that you have to remove the case if you want to mount the camera to a tripod. Usually not the case for a small pocket point-and-shoot camera.  Also, it would be a great plus if it has a mini-pocket for additional memory card or battery.The wrap is black and elegant. Made of quality stretchable material. Made in China.This is one of the cheapest and most effective solutions to protect a small camera.  Perfect companion for my Fuji J28.</text>

        <text>This is an interesting and non traditional case. I have a Canon S90 and wasn't very excited about getting a normal bulky case for it. This wrap is great for protecting the camera if you want to just throw it in a bag for a trip or in my case keep it protected in my wife's purse.When you unwrap it, the large amount of material that dangles from the camera is a bit awkward, but at least it stays attached so that you don't lose it or forget to protect the camera.All in all it's a pretty cost effective case to casually protect your camera from getting scratched or damaged in a purse, bag or suitcase and it stays on pretty well when shooting making it a bit more convenient than a normal camera case.</text>

        <text>When I saw that Vine was offering Lowepro D-Wrap, I jumped on it because I own several point-and-shoot cameras.  This camera wrap asserts that it fits (or stretches to fit) most cameras.  Unfortunately, that does not include my Canon A630 PowerShot.While the wrap stretches, it would require three strong men to stretch it around my Canon.  So, even though it screwed into the tripod mount as advertised, it would mean more effort to get it into place than I could give it.Giving up on my Canon, I tried it on my Flip video camera.  Yes, it folds over and protects it nicely, unless, that is, you screw it into the tripod mount.  At that point, it become impossible to stretch it over the entire camera because at that point the camera is vertical and too tall to fit.Finally, I tried it on my mother's Kodak SureShot.  Voila! It fits (with a moderate amount of stretching).  It's open at the ends, so the camera is still subject to foreign objects entering from the side, but it does protect the lens and viewing screen from dust and other undesirables while the camera is in purse or pocket.By the way, if you carry your camera in your pocket, you'll probably want to have a large pocket because the neoprene does not slide around easily in a close space and will not slip down into a tight jeans pocket.So would I recommend this camera glove?  It depends.  It depends on the size of your point-and-shoot camera.  It depends on how often you use your camera and whether you've already got camera protection. Those who already have a case they use will probably not benefit from this D-wrap.</text>

    <sentence id="9698">
        <text>This is a unique camera case.  Instead of being separate, it becomes "part of it" by attaching to it.  It does this by attaching to the tripod hole, and stretches across the body of the camera.  The sides aren't protected, but it seems to be okay for most purposes.  Unstrapping the case, will allow it to fold down, allowing you to use the camera, and the thing remains hanging from it...no need to put away or find your case again.  It's different and I like the idea, but I really want the protection from a normal case that won't allow as much dirt/dust in.  It's not bad, and it serves it's purpose well enough.  I could see this being a good choice for those who aren't too picky about these things.</text>

        <text>I bought this for my iphone 4.  Loved the idea of a lightweight folding stand.  It's simply a piece of plastic scored in the middle so it can fold, with a soft plastic band on the 'feet' to both stabilize it and grip the iphone/ipod.  Good simple design that would work, except that the iphone 4 is too heavy for it. When used upright, the iphone tilts the stand over.  When used sideways, the legs bend slightly, but it does work that way.I'm going to rate this high because it IS exactly what they claim it is, and they never claimed it would work for the iphone 4.

This sits in my wallet and it's there when I need it... nothing to remember.I give this top rating, but beware that it is not highly sturdy. Your devide just "rests" in the cradle, which is very well designed to hold it but other products - more expensive and larger - clip on so you can rest the devide your chest to watch a video in bed.

        <text>This very simple stand has a lot going for it.  It's cheap, especially compared to most iPhone stands.  It's universal and not tied to a specific brand or model.

It's even adjustable in that it has 2 places to rest the phone, each rest holding the phone at a different angel.I'm taking away one star because it just isn't quite strong enough and not quite wide enough.  I bought this to use with my iPhone while plugged into my computer.  If I'm not very careful when setting it up, the weight of the cord will knock the phone down.

It's about as thick as a credit card, although a bit longer.What's it good for? Well, my number 1 thing is reading while eating. I often eat alone and I like to read while doing so. With my Crabble, I can set my phone wherever I want and be able to read in perfect comfort. It's also invaluable for plane travel, as it allows me to stand my phone on my tray table.

        <text>I purchased this unit when the price dropped below $50.  I wanted to compare this to my other bluetooth (BT) headset, which is the Jawbone PRIME Bluetooth Headset Ear Candy Edition (Drop Me a Lime Green).  I owned the PRIME before buying this PRO, and having used both units I can honestly say IMHO that although the Jawbone PRIME has a better sound quality (just BARELY and ever so slightly better), this Voyager PRO does the job just as well.  The bottom line is that the Plantronics Voyager PRO is an excellent bluetooth headset.  I alternate between this Voyager PRO and the Jawbone PRIME, using one while the other charges.Let me first describe everything that is great about it:- One of the best sound quality of all the BT headsets I've used (and I've gone through plenty), second only to the Jawbone Prime.  I heard the person on the other end very clearly, and I was clear to the other person as well.  No complaints from the other caller when I used this BT headset, unlike when I used the Motorola H500 or the Plantronics Explorer 220 where my voice was cut-off about 25% of the time.- Very loud (or loud enough).  I've set my phone's earpiece volume to MED using this Voyager PRO BT unit.- One of the best noise cancellation technology IMHO.  I am utterly amazed with how well the dual-mic technology works.  It works with low-to-moderate background noise when you are in a car, in a store, in starbucks, etc.- Easily switch from one ear to the other by rotating the earpiece.- It is lightweight and compact, though it loses out to the Jawbone Prime on this category.  Having said that, I have not lost this headset once, whereas I've lost the Prime several times due to its compactness.- Very easy to put on, and once it is on its stays on.  This feature is what edges out the Prime.  With the Prime, it takes a a while to figure out the proper configuration to get it to stay in your ear.  With the Voyager Pro, just loop around the ear, move the mic boom, and it will stay on.  I've jogged a 5K race with this on... just to prove to my friends that it will stay put (and it did!).- It is very easy to pair with my phones.- The battery life is excellent/very good.  I can go through the whole day of moderate use (about 4 hours of talk time) with a single overnight charge.  I've gone two days without recharging.  I won't dare go three, but seeing how cheap these units are now, maybe I'll get another unit.- MicroUSB interface means that I can use my cell phone charger to charge this (and vice-versa).- Fast power-up and connect.  I keep this unit off while I wear it, and when I get a call, I turn it on and it can connect between the second and third ring.Now, the negatives:- At first, I was used to the sound clarity of the Jawbone PRIME, so this Voyager PRO sounded a bit tinny to my ears.  However, after finding the proper ear gel that fits me, the sound clarity is now just as good as the Jawbone PRIME.- It is larger and bulkier than the Jawbone PRIME.  However, it is not as big as its predecessor (Voyager).  I wish this unit had a charging base like the Voyager.- There is no battery indicator that tells me how much charge is left.  I understand that the Voyager PRO+ has a feature where if paired with an iPhone the iPhone will display the charge capacity of this BT headset.Obviously, there is still room for improvement.  If the Voyager PRO+ works just as well as this PRO unit, and if it has the charger indicator for a Blackberry (or any other phone), I may have to rank it higher.  For now, this unit deserves a 4.5 star rating (rounded down).  It's almost perfect.IMHO I will have to state that the current price (under $50) and the features and quality of the Plantronics Voyager Pro makes it one of the best BT headsets I've ever used.  This is, of course, highly subjective, and there may be other better bluetooth headsets that I have not tried.  I highly recommend the Voyager PRO.</text>

        <text>Voyager Pro isn't discrete. If you want discrete there are other models out there (the Jawbone) but I have to say that this Bluetooth does offer great call quality. I live in NYC and to say it's noisy at all times of the day/night would be an understatement and I had no issues hearing every call clearly and louder. The button placement for volume is located on the rounded edge of the headset. It is kind of hard to press and you do feel the pressure on the back of the ear, which is not a good thing if you are in a rush, the sudden sharp pain is a bit intense.Again, my only real gripe with the Voyager is the size. It doesn't have weight to it, but it is bulky. And if you have small ears, like I do, that are close your head, it does tend to draw them out. But it may be worth the trade for the excellent sound quality. For the ultimate test in its truly amazing call quality, I spoke in the room while my children slept, almost at a whisper, and my husband heard me clearly with no issues at all and the phone was sitting on the mantle in a very large living space.</text>

        <text>I recently purchased this product from amazon for its noise-canceling audioIQ technology. I wanted to use it mainly for in the car and on my moped. However, upon using it I was greatly disappointed! The bluetooth is very cheaply made, I cannot understand what I am paying $70 for! I tested it several times after the recommended full charge and several problems occurred: the max volume and the clarity of the call.I had to turn up the volume to compensate for the poor clarity of the call. Instead of crisp audio, what I heard several times on end was an echo-like quality of sound. It was very difficult to hear my girlfriend when I was standing outside the car in the parking lot. Another instance (while driving), I had to turn the air conditioning practically off so that I could hear my contact speaking to me. The max volume is also very limited, it had difficulty when walking by a busy park and the volume was just not loud enough. It was ridiculous! Though I asked many times how well she could here me through the line, and she said very well. She didn't even know that I was using a bluetooth- in fact she was wondering why my voice sounded so much clearer than it usually does when I call her. So kudos to the voice capturing system (AudioIQ).Second issue was the clarity of the incoming signal. The next contact I called was a mile away from me, both with Verizon and both with the same reception bars (3 out of 4). However, I could hardly hear the nuances in his voice. Not at all what I expected after reading the reviews of this product! The voices (all of my contacts) had an echoing tone and was distracting and I had to spend most of my time trying to figure out what they said than proceeding with my part of the conversation.I would also like to mention that the controls to the ProVoyager were pretty poorly designed. The buttons have to be pressed fairly hard, changing the desired position of the earpiece. A minor annoyance, but after a while, an unbearable process. And the voice command button (along the base of the boom) is a bit tricky to use. When pressed it pushes into my ear (fairly uncomfortable) and again, repositions the device on my ear.So I will be returning it for the Plantronics Voyager which costs $40 and is a lot more reliable. Thanks for reading. Good luck!</text>

My petite wife did not believe me in saying that it was so light just as any other "in ear" piece until she tried it.This headset can be finicky BUT I've used Motorola and Samsung headsets as well, and I believe it's more inherent of the bluetooth spec than the quality of these items hence why there is bluetooth 3.0...4.0 and most likely will keep going on until the tech becomes "reliable".</text>

        <text>If you can find it, the refurbished model is amazing value. It came in bubble wrap, no clunky packaging, just an instruction manual and charger.  The full price model also comes with a set of small and large earbuds (the medium bud fits my ear just fine, as I expect it will most people).I listened to a voicemail I'd left while a horse was walking directly in front of me, and about 1 second after I'd started speaking, the CLIP CLOP almost completely cut out.  Impressive.  The background traffic was inaudible too.When speaking with nothing in the background, a friend confirmed I sounded perfect and not like I was on a cellphone.Now, you can't quite speak softly with gale force winds blowing around you, but if it's really windy and you speak up, you can be heard, although the other party will know you're outdoors in a noisy environment.  So it's not magic, but it's really good.I would suggest spending a few minutes practicing putting it on with one hand.  It's fiddly, like many wireless headsets, but once you get the hang of it (including noticing when the boom has been accidentally rotated to fit the opposite ear, which can happen easily) it becomes effortless, so you're not struggling to put it on while answering a call!The manual states that if the cellphone goes out of range, one tap on the power button will re-connect, but that didn't work with my Nokia 6300, and I have to power the headset off and on again.It's nice that tapping the power button shows how much battery life remains, depending on whether you see 1, 2, or 3 flashes.I used to have a first-generation Jabra headset, with frequent poor sound quality: this is a world of difference!</text>

        <text>I typically don't spend a lot on a wireless headset.  I've found most of the ones I've used to be very good, and I've used my old Logitec Mobile Freedom headset for close to five years and I've always found it to work great. My requirements are the basics: good sound quality, comfort, and cutting down wind/background noise.I could not be happier with the Plantronics Voyager Pro.  It does cost a bit more than some others, but you get what you pay for.  This things has very good sound quality on both ends, all but eliminates wind noise when driving, even with the windows open, and it remains comfortable.  I've had it on my head for the bulk of a day while on conference calls, and hardly noticed it was there.So....what's in the box?* The Voyager Pro headset* Three sizes of soft gel eartips* Two foam eartip covers* AC Charger* User GuideSetup of the Voyager Pro is typical of a headset.  It charges quickly, usable within a half hour or so and fully charged in 90 minutes.  It pairs easily with phones.  Just turn the headset on and it goes into pairing mode.  It remains in pairing mode for 10 minutes.The microphone is a little larger than most other headsets, but not a huge deal.  The dual microphones with excellent sound quality more than make up for that.Controls are simple to use:* Volume button on the top of the earpiece: press the front (+) to increase volume and rear (-) to lower it.  Or press both + and - to mute, and you get a voice prompt of "Mute On"!* A mini USB port is located on the earpiece bottom for charging.* The 'Call Control' button is located on the center of the earpiece.  this button does everything from answer/end calls, transfer between the headset and phone, decline a call, redial, voice-activated redial, or even check if the device is powered on.I found that this product holds a charge nicely.  I used about 5 hours of talk time in a 10 hour period and still left the device on all night and it was fine this morning, and I used it for another hour or two today.Of course lots of things impact your talk time and even your standby time.I pair this device with my Motorola Razr V3 as well as a Blackberry Curve 8310 and have tried it on a Pantech Matrix C740 too.  No issues pairing and functioning.So, OK - lots of products have these features so why pay more for the Voyager Pro.  If you use a headset infrequently, perhaps just to chat briefly with a friend and are mostly indoors, you probably will be happy with a less expensive product.  However, if you are in the car a lot, with a good deal of background noise, especially road/wind noise, the performance of this unit in that respect alone makes it a consideration for purchase.  Coupled with the overall high sound quality, I would say this product is perfect for someone who requires high quality sound on conference calls when they are mobile.</text>

        <text>At my office, for years, I have used thePlantronics CS70/HL10 DECT 6.0 Bundle Wireless Headset System with Lifterand love it.  It fits perfectly, is full of volume and microphone adjustments and I don't notice it is on me.I have also used thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] as my primary headset with my previous Motorola RAZR and loved it.  However, when I switched to the iPhone 3GS, people couldn't hear me well anymore.Upon first using the Voyager Pro, the other person sounded more digitized than the 510.  Also, my biggest problem with this headset -- the other person sounds quiet, tinny and distant.  I tried the various earpieces with and without the felt cover, but it was all the same.  In comparing the 510 with this model, the 510's earpiece goes much deeper into the ear canal, getting the speaker deeper in, creating a better sound and sealing out other sounds.  Even when pushing in the Voyager Pro, the earpiece collapses instead of going deeper in.I had these hearing issues with the volume all the way up with the windows up in the car.  If I had the windows down, it would be impossible to hear.I wasn't impressed with the controls of the Voyager Pro compared with the 510 either.  The power button is difficult to find and push compared to the 510.  The volume button are difficult to distinguish from one another.  On the 510, each has a different slope, making it easy to know which is which.  The answer/hang up/voice dial button forces you to smash the whole headset into your ear canal to activate and it is difficult to know whether you are pressing it.  On the 510, you could hear the button being pushed or let off and you could easily counteract the force with your thumb behind, keeping the earpiece from crushing your ear.This is just not usable for me, I will be returning it.  Now back to the drawing board.</text>

Do they mean it has an 80dB signal to noise ratio? It doesn't. I doubt it is 10dB. The first thing I did with it was call my wife, who was sitting next to me. She answered on speaker-phone so I could hear the call quality and we had a laugh about the long duration echo she heard on her phone. So that means it was clearly picking up her phone which certainly wasn't my mouth, so it is very sensitive to outside sound.Having use aviation and military headsets which have proper noise cancelling microphones I can only describe the claims for this device as laughable.But compared to other crummy consumer headsets it is at least clear for the person you are calling.With 600 other reviews of this product nobody is ever going to read this, but if anyone does at least you won't have unreasonable expectations.</text>

        <text>I have used many Bluetooth head sets in my time and this is the best.My previously unit was the Plantronics 510 that has been so highly rated wherever opinions are recorded.  The Voyager Pro is the next generation of that head set.I purchased this headset from Plantronics the very first day it became available and they offered a free car charger with purchase.  I say this because I've been using the PRO every day, all day since.  As a matter of fact two days ago I left in a restaurant and was so panicked I was going to order a new one overnighted at any cost; that's how much I enjoy and need this product!  Thank goodness a Good Samaritan turned it in.Pros:- Very good incoming and outgoing sound quality.- Very good noise reduction.- No blue blinking on the unit to distract others.- Very good unit comfort because of the balanced weight behind the ear.- Gel ear insert is an improvement over the previous version (which wasn't bad either).  I've not had this ear piece come off one time ... this is an improved feature over the 510.- Less static than other Bluetooth sets.- Distinctive on/off tones that leave you no doubt as to unit status.- Verbal low battery message (very cool).- Charges very quickly.Cons: (I'm struggling here)- Perhaps a little less battery life than the 510.  I need to insert here the fact that I'm in business development and use around 5000 minutes per month.

I've had many a call that ask me if Im on a land line when I've been on my Voyager/Pro.

        <text>This Plaintronics Voyager Pro is the Nokia behind-the ear headset that was available several years ago, updated with modern electronics, and flexible design that the Nokia lacked.I called my own answering machine to see what this headset sounded like, and it sounded easily as good as a wired desk phone. There was no weird echo or hollow comb-filtering you sometimes hear in boom type headsets or duplex radio sets.After settling on the "small" sized ear insert without the foam cover-ting, I just left the thing on my right ear to see how long I could stand having it there.Pretty soon I had forgotten it was there. This has never happened before.A note for those who don't read all the instructions, the little earpieces mount into the headsets by a bayonet-type 1/4 turn twist, so don't try to just pull the things straight off the mount or you may rip the soft material. Three different sizes are included, and aftermarket replacements of three of your chosen size are available here.The unit charged fully in a couple of hours and comes with a wall-wart charger which is typical for units like this.The audio cues the set gives are helpful, once you learn what the various tone-codes mean. The set gets L-O-U-D too. If you're working in a noisy environment you will probably love this unit.A tap on the earpiece switch (which is located right at the ear insert on the outside,) and a call is answered or dropped. The switch is so well integrated you can't even see it in the photos here.It's kind of difficult to find the exact right "P.C." words to describe the aesthetics other than to say it looks like it was not designed as a fashion accessory just for women. Looks like professional communications equipment, but does not resemble a tactical military headset, either. A nice compromise between no-nonsense and professional good looks.I did find that the duplex can be "fooled" by brushing against the microphones while listening to someone and that will start overriding incoming audio. Don't know if this is common with all noise cancelling or other BT headsets. The answer is, don't tap or rub the mics when listening to someone or voice messages. :-)To sum up:-Sounds like a good, wired desk phone-Loud when you want it to be-Adjusts and so comfortable you forget it's there-Looks professional without being Tacti-cool.Great price now at Amazon from the original retail. If I had to do it over again I'd choose this one without thinking twice.</text>

        <text>I preface this review with the caveat that I started using the Voyager Pro at the same time I purchased the Motorola Droid X. I suspect the excellence of the Android design is helping with my bluetooth success after all these years. Previously I had HTC Windows Mobile phones and before that Treos. I tried 7 different bluetooth headsets in the past but had to discontinue each due to callers complaining they couldn't hear me well. I persisted because working Bluetooth is valuable to me in my work with clients.I've been using the Voyager Pro for about a year. It's worked so well I bought a second one so I always have one charged up and ready to go. I use my mobile phone for many hours a day with the Voyager Pro and have never gotten one complaint about clarity, volume level or choppiness. Even though its physically large its design is so well balanced I forget I'm wearing it.The controls are simple and well placed, it warns me when battery is low but keeps working for about 20 minutes giving me time to swap out. When I turn it on it pairs immediately without fuss unlike my past experiences.I bought the holster for it so I don't have to constantly wear it but have it at hand at all times.</text>

I do plan on replacing it with another Voyager PRO.I enjoy this headset so much, I have purchased one for both my spouse and mother, each of whom are very satisfied with their bluetooth.The only down side to this headset is if you have small ears, or wear bulky glasses, then the device does seem to be obstructive and bulky. Otherwise, it's very lightweight, and the noise-cancellation feature makes for good phone communication (I once had an entire conversation with someone while driving with the window open, and nothing was commented by the recipient on the other end).</text>

        <text>I've been through a few Bluetooth devices and the most common shortcomings have been 1. Doesn't stay in your ear, 2. Shotty call quality and 3, rediculous or very short range.  Respectfully, much of this is dependant on the phone also i.e. pairing with a blackberry may well work out better than pairing with a lower quality device.  Not withstanding that input, I can say I haven't had in sub premium phones but still fell victim to inferior bluetooth devices.  This headset is impressive though considerably larger because.... 1. It stays in and on my ear, 2. Sounds exceptional, even people I've spoken to state I sound better speaking through the bluetooth than when I'm speaking into the phone directly and 3. I can walk away from the phone probably in the range of about 20 to 30 feet and still have a connection with the phone though you'll start to hear static.  I highly recommend this appliance to all and rate it very highly.  Just for those who might want to know, I have a blackberry storm.  Good Job Plantronics!!!!</text>

        <text>I bought this headset based on the excellent product reviews plus my own experience with the Plantronics "over the head" wireless headsets we use in the office.Positives:+ The Plantronics Voyager is very easy to set up and pair with a bluetooth phone.+ The people I talk to report that the sound quality on the other end is very clear.+ Excellent battery life.+ Reversible feature is very clever -- the headset can be worn on either side.+ The headset is lightweight and surprisingly comfortable.Negatives:- For me, the headset does not fit well, which has a significant impact on sound volume on my end.  Given the angle at which the earpiece is attached to the electronics/battery compartment, the earpiece won't stay firmly seated in my ear, which makes it hard to hear even at the highest volume.  I have to use my free hand to keep the earpiece pushed firmly into my ear canal, which defeats the purpose of a hands-free headset.- The controls are very tiny and hard to manipulate without looking.  Specifically, the position of the volume controls on top of the unit makes them hard to use while driving.- The primary control (for taking calls, hanging up, etc.) is on the outside surface of the earbud.  Given the problems I have keeping the earpiece firmly seated in my ear, I often have to push the device more firmly into my ear; and given the position of the off switch, it means that I routinely inadvertently hang up on calls.In a nutshell:  If this device fits for you, you can can expect the usual Plantronics quality, which is excellent.  But if it doesn't fit, it will be frustrating to use (after a month, I stopped using mine and switched to a different hands-free solution).  Unfortunately, I don't know of any way to "try on" the headset unless you have a friend who owns this model.</text>

        <text>I wanted to get this out there in case it helps someone else.When I first paired the VP with my Samsung Behold (easy) and started checking it out, I was immediately disappointed with the sound quality. (Read on - this was just a setting issue) It sounded like it was full of static and as another reviewer mentioned, if I held my phone right near the VP, the sound would become clear. That's not how it's supposed to work, though.With some experimentation I figured it out. Since it first seemed like a signal strength issue, and I had bought a silicone boot for my Behold, I thought maybe it was attenuating the Bluetooth signal and causing the problem. I took off the boot but no luck -- same level of static.Cutting to the chase, the problem wasn't signal strength though I can't explain holding the phone near the VP clearing up the signal. What did fix things was turning off "Remote SIM Mode" in the Bluetooth settings on the phone.Remote SIM Mode allows car phone kits to access information on your SIM card. I have no need to have this turned on and can't help but think that allowing it is a security risk.Now, with Remote SIM Mode turned off, the sound quality is great and I can work on getting used to the controls and features. One thing about the VP I can tell already is that it is very comfortable. I have no experience with Bluetooth earpieces but do have with wired ones and this is much more comfortable. I also like being able to initiate calls strictly with the VP and voice recognition commands.I don't know if this Remote SIM Mode thing will be important to me at some time or not. I also don't know if the issue with having it enabled and getting static is the fault of the VP or the Samsung Behold. With there being more than one person having the same issue with multiple different makes and models of phones, it would tend to imply it could be the VP or just a fundamental issue with the Bluetooth implementation of Remote SIM Mode. But anyone having the static issue should see if their phone supports this and allows them to turn it off.After a few weeks with the VP, I really like it. Sound is clear. The audio cues are great. Battery life seems fine.Anyone having problems with noise, please check your phone to see if remote SIM is running and try the VP with it turned off. I'm now regretting giving it 4 stars when brand new - it deserves 5 stars.</text>

        <text>Plantronics makes some of the best headsets ... both wired and bluetooth ... in terms of sound quality and this headset does not disappoint.  I would often have problems using bluetooth headsets outside if there was any wind because the wind sound is what was transmitted to the person I'm talking to and not my voice.  This headset does a good job correcting that issue with the "noise canceling technology".  And the price point is pretty good, all things considered.That's the good news.The bad news is that it was uncomfortable to wear and the relatively long "boom" made it embarrassing to be seen in.  I'm assuming that it must have been designed for males with larger heads.  The piece that fits in the ear was obviously not designed for a woman's ear because it was too big and I was always wanting to whack it away -- defeating the purpose of the headset in the first place.I much preferAltec Lansing 906/R US BackBeat Headphone with Donglebecause it is more comfortable and feel like the sound quality is better.

        <text>The Plantronics Pro Voyager is hands down, the best sounding Bluetooth headset that I've tried.I've used multiple Bluetooth headsets over the years, Motorolas, Jawbones, and other Plantronics models.  The Plantronics models have always had the best sound and usually the best fit of any earpiece, and the Voyager Pro is no exception.  There is a soft, squishy ear bud that fits into your ear.  I normally hate earbuds because they don't stay in my ear, but these soft buds fit in and stay in.  There are also a couple sizes of earbuds in the package.  By having an earpiece that fits inside your ear, and not outside--like most Motorolas, what you hear on your end is louder and clearer sound without a lot of ambient background noise.  I view this as a plus.  In addition, there is a loop that fits over your ear to secure the fit.  Unlike the Plantronic 640-680 line, the ear loop not an add-on, but it's actually part of the headset in the Voyager Pro.  The ear piece fits securely, and doesn't feel too weighty.  There is a long boom mic that protrudes from the ear piece and reaches about halfway down your cheek.  The mic is sensitive and provides good outgoing sound quality.  It holds up well in a car while driving, however, don't expect miracles if you're outside on a windy day; the Voyager will still pick up some wind background noise.The Voyager Pro can save it's settings to pair with two different devices.  I had it pair a RAZR, Centro, Xenon, and also my PS3.  Although I didn't test the sound quality on my PS3, it worked great for all of the phones I tried it with.As far as negatives go, the biggest thing is that the thing is...big.  There is a long boom mic coming out of your ear.  So if you're walking around downtown, it might not be the coolest looking thing on the planet.  However, if you're looking for outstanding sound quality and a good fit in your ear, you can't go wrong with the Voyager Pro.</text>

It broke where it was supposed to pivit while inserting it in my ear one day.  I glued it back and got another 5 months of use before it simply quit working.  I attempted to replace the large ear insert, and could not buy them with the covers.  I had to change a flat tire in the sun one day, and I guess my sweat, or the heat of being in my ear in the 95 degree sun killed it.  I've done a lot more with the older Voyager 510, it still works, but after nearly six years the battery isn't charging well, so it is time to replace.

The battery lasts all day, even with an hour and a half or two worth of active talk-time.  Now for the downsides: it's still a Bluetooth headset, so sound quality isn't perfect; it's much bulkier and more awkward than other headsets; it's damn expensive.

Also, my research shows that the Pro has the upper hand when it came to straight audio performance. It excels in both areas. Here are some of my thoughts and impressions on different aspects of the device.First, the size and fit... Do NOT worry about the size of the device. It appears much larger and more intimidating in photos than it is in person. It's actually a very comfortable, manageable size. When it's on your ear, it doesn't seem out of place. It seems appropriate and looks quite nice and professional. The behind the ear design means that the device is VERY stable. Once it's in place, I can move freely about with no fear that it will fall out. I can swing my head around in all directions, and I never feel as though it's going to fall out.It's also VERY comfortable. I totally agree with other reviewers who say they forget that they're wearing it. Very easy to do. It is very light... Barely over half an ounce, it is barely noticeable at all. It is perfectly balanced, so it doesn't flop or pull in any direction. It feels solid and I completely forget that I have it on. I've worn it for several hours at a time at work, and don't even feel it. It has never made my ear sore, nor the inside of my ear. The ear bud fittings are completely comfortable.Second, the buttons and features... Do NOT worry about the placement of the on/off switch, as some reviewers have mentioned. It is on the rear of the ear piece, and once you get used to it, it is easy to find and press. The volume buttons are on top, and are very naturally placed and easy to use. And the answer button is on the outside of the ear bud, very commonly placed like many bluetooth devices... In my opinion, I would prefer the answer button to be on top, but that's my personal preference.You can answer a call with one short press, and hang up the call with one short press. You can also long press and use voice activation to make a call, if your phone offers that ability. Or, you can long press when a call comes in to automatically refuse the call and send it to voicemail. You can short press twice to automatically redial the last number.Once your on a call, you can mute the call and hear an audible confirmation say 'Mute On' or 'Mute Off'. You can also switch between the headset and the phone easily. And you can pair the headset with more than one device. The volume goes louder than most other headsets I've tried. That, plus the design of the ear bud, plus the superior sound quality means that volume should not be an issue for you. It is plenty loud enough for me.Also, the battery lasts a LONG time. 90 minutes will fully charge the battery, and you get 6 hours of talk time. I don't have any issues running out of battery. Plus, when it does get low, the device notifies you with a voice that says 'Battery Low' and 'Recharge Battery'Third, sound quality and performance... It's amazing, plain and simple. The call quality is truly second to none. I was very impressed once I heard it for myself. When I'm on the headset, people tell me they can't tell. They always say I sound great, and don't cut in or out. And the best part is the wind/noise cancellation abilities. When I'm in the car with wind/road noise, my voice still sounds clear to them. Plus, callers always sound great to me, despite the noise conditions where they're at. It simply out performs any other headsets I've tried. And for this price, it is a steal.At Best Buy the Voyager Pro will cost you 99.00, but I got mine from my local Fry's store for 69.00 and paid an additional 11.00 for a two year, in store, replacemente warranty if it ever breaks. So my 81.00 investment is still cheaper than B.B. So, you should definitely grab one at this price. I would easily pay 99.00 for one if I had to, no hesitations.If you're debating between the Voyager Pro and the Discovery 975, then my research shows that although the 975 is newer, and offers a few more features with voice commands, the Pro still has the superior audio performance. Also, the 975 is not a behind the ear design, so it is less stable than the Pro. Plus the 975 is 60.00 more than the Pro. So, just truse me and get this. The Plantronics Voyager Pro is the best bluetooth of all the high end ones that I or any of my friends has, or has had, hands down.Hope this was helpful...*** UPDATE: JAN 2011 ***My girlfriend just bought the Discovery 975 yesterday, and we spent a couple hours testing it against my Voyager Pro for sound quality. Hands down, the Voyager Pro is completely superior!The noise cancelling, and wind reduction is noticeably better on my Pro. We tested them standing in front of a fan and air conditioner... Both blocked all the noise when you're not talking, but the 975 had interference when talking in the wind. The Pro was far better.We also tested it near a faucet and running water. Same noticeable difference... The 975 was particularly noisy and hard to listen to when near running water. The Pro blocked it out nicely.Outside near heavy traffic, also the same. The Pro was hands down superior. Also with heavy breathing and yawning. We were both really disappointed. She was hoping the 975 would be great because she can't wear the Pro comfortably because of her ear. She is returning it today and sticking with her old one.So, it's true what the professional reviewers say about the Pro having superior sound quality. All my testing proves the same.Hope that helps...</text>

        <text>The first thing that I thought when I opened the package was BIG, this thing is too big! measuring 1.8" x 2.3" x 0.4" (4" wide if you count the mic) The retro look took me back to the good old days when I had a wired headset running down a cable from my ear all the way to my front pocket.The second thing that I noticed was that it comes with no car charger, it comes with a home charger, which is ok for most people but for someone like me who only uses the headset while driving, it makes it a little inconvenient.The third thing that I noticed kinda weird was that the instruction booklet was in spanish! but then I realised that I was reading the second half of the manual... The first half is the english side!It only took me about 2 minutes max to sync the Voyager PRO to my phone. I placed it around my ear and much to my surprise, it felt good, not heavy at all and very comfortable. once you have it on, all you can really see is the mic sticking out.I figured I would call my wife since she's the only person who would let me test it without asking me "why do you keep on asking me how you sound?"So I called her and pumped up the volume on the headset just to get a feel for the buttons (which are on the perfect spot)After asking her how her day was and not paying attention to her answer due to my interest in the sound quality only, I noticed that there was some static going on, just when I was thinking that, she asked "what's wrong with your phone?" I said "nothing, what's wrong with yours?" she said "are you going through a tunnel, because I can't really hear what you're saying" I told her I would call her back.I hung up the phone and called one of my friends, I told him I was testing my new headset and that I wanted to see if he could hear me clear, for which he replied "what? I can't hear you dude!" I told him I would call him back and hung up the phone.I went back to step one, I removed the headset from my phone's set up and restarted both gadgets, once again, it took me less then two minutes to sync them together.I called my wife once more and asked "can you hear me now?" she said "yeah, what was wrong with your phone?" I could hear her with such clarity that I didn't mind looking like a cyborg from an 80's movie in exchange for perfect voice quality!I can honestly say that my BlueAnt V1 is now 2nd best compared to the Voyager PRO when it comes to sound quality, there's a new kid in town! Now if next time Plantronics can do something about those looks, that would be great!</text>

        <text>I always used a wired headset for many years with my cellphones, as I could never find one that really worked. They were either too fragile, battery didn't last long, can't hear the other end or the person on the end can't hear me or all of the above. I bought no less than five, then ended up returning them because I was not satisfied.However, this year, headset technology apparently has seen so much improvements. I bought a Blue-Ant this year and thought it worked great. Then come along the Plantronics PRO! When I talked using this headset, the person on the end had no idea I used a headset. And I can hear them fine, just like using a landline. I am sure that is the experience you will find with this wonderfull headset. And that is the most important thing.The headset is feather-light and fully adjustable. The ear-piece and mike swivel all directions, so it is easy to fit to the contour of your face. I like the boom mike, I can make sure that fit properly near my mouth when I talk. It is not as compact as most other headset, but very comfortable to wear. It also does nothave annoying flashing blue light so you won't get dirty look from people around you. Pairing it to the phone is super simple, took about 2 minutes. Effective range is good, I can talk fine with my cellphone in a different room more than 30 feet away.One thing I found, that if I don't use the headset for half a day, it seems to go offline and I have to reconnect it (not re-pair) on my cell phone. But it is simple enough, I just touch the Plantronics headset icon on my Samsung Eternity. The manual said the battery lasts 5 days on stand-by, but I guess it is depended on how much you use it. I used it about once or twice a day, and it is still going after a week.Highly recommend.</text>

        <text>Anybody who has used any headset in either wired or wireless configuration would certainly have been familiar with Plantronics. They are a company specializing in headset peripherals for business and home use. When the bluetooth headsets for cell phones started flooding the market, the one I chose was the Explorer 330. I have been using this since 2005 and the performance was more than what I expected. I am still using it now. When I got the Voyager PRO, I know I would be getting the same quality technology from Plantronics and I wasn't disappointed.This headset is full in features. One feature I especially liked is the noise-canceling and anti-wind feature where you can talk without the background noise even if it coming from the wind. Pairing was flawless on my phone that took less than a minute. The design was also very good, very technologically-savy design. It also comes with different-sized silicone ear tips and ear covers that caters to different fits of the ear. Its also very versatile and comfortable even for long periods of time that I even forget wearing one were it not for the sound I hear when my phone is ringing. Overall a very good product I would expect from Plantronics. It has surpassed every expectation I have with this company as a previous user of their products. I highly recommend this.</text>

I tested both with same phone (Blackberry) and set max volume levels on both phone and bluetooth..  The 510 was around 25% louder IMO.  I'm going to return this one.</text>

        <text>Like the title of my review suggests, the Plantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth headset is the best quality, easiest to use mobile phone headset I've ever used ... and I've used five different Bluetooth headsets in the last two years.I was a bit concerned by the picture of the headset because it looks pretty massive in the photos. However, I find this headset to be just the right size and it fits around my ear without being to heavy or forcing my ear to stick out. The adjustable earpieces help you create the perfect fit, but the earpiece that came attached to the Yoyager PRO inside the box seems to work just right with my ear.Pairing the device with my Motorola Q9m smartphone was extremely easy and the Voyager PRO stays connected quite well ... even when I was more than 20 feet away from my phone. I've used the headset for at least 25 different phone calls ranging in length from less than five minutes to more than 30 minutes with almost zero problems. I have to say "almost" because I did have one odd phone call where the caller's voice came through sounding very distorted and I had to turn off the hands free mode on my phone and then turn it on again in order to get the Voyager PRO to output a voice that sounded normal. That was the only reason I gave this headset four stars and not a full five stars.In terms of performance, the always-on noise cancellation technology works well and people always claimed they couldn't tell I was using a Bluetooth headset when they heard me on the phone. The pivoting mic boom allows me to position the mic exactly where I want it and should help people who want to use this headset on their left ear.The automatic voice prompts for low battery and mute status don't always sound clear, but you can make them out. I never tested the multipoint technology for connecting two devices simultaneously to the headset, but I suppose that is a useful feature if you have two Bluetooth phones.Plantronics claims that the Voyager PRO has up to 6 hours of talk time or up to 120 hours (5 days) of standby time and I suspect that battery life estimate is pretty close to being accurate based on my time spent using the headset.Bottom line, I would recommend this headset to anyone looking for a good Bluetooth headset. It isn't perfect, but I haven't found a single Bluetooth headset that is.</text>

        <text>I have used Motorola 850's for years.  Issue with it is:  They are now hard to find and their durability is poor, so I elected to try the Voyager Pro.Pros:  It is very comfortable; I have worn it all day and eventually didn't notice it was there.  The speech quality received by the person I was calling was excellent.  Wind noise is lower than my 850, judged by several people I called.  Because the ear piece sits on the ear canal with a soft rubber sealing cushion, surrounding noises are also reduced.Cons:  The voice quality I am receiving, from many different callers, is below the quality of my Motorola 850.  But not by a lot.Unlike the 850 where turning the unit off was a simple matter of closing the boom microphone.  The Voyager requires you to push a button and wait for the red light to come on to shut it off.  If removed from your ear and not shut off, your phone will not ring; ringing will be from the Voyager which you will not be able to hear.Overall, however, the Voyager is a good substitute for my beloved 850.</text>

        <text>With much anticipation, I tried the Jawbone Icon, eager to believe some of the rave reviews it has had. What a disappointment. The earhook is so flimsy that it came apart in the first 10 minutes. I had not opted to use the earbud only (don't trust those - always scared it will come out of my ear) - and although I tried two different size buds as well as the earhook, it was so loose that if I shook my head even slightly, it came out. The call sound was average - nothing to write home about, but after 30 minutes of having to constantly keep pushing it back into my ear and reattach the ear hook, I took it off and returned it. WASTE OF TIME. I then bought the Plantronics Voyager Pro and have to say that for stability, it is rock solid- it stays on my ear very well, stays in place, and the sound is like no other bluetooth I have had - even when driving, it has loud, good, clear sound and people that I ask say they hear me very clearly and loudly. The microphone is quite a bit longer than the other bluetooth headsets out there and it actually looks like a microphone - some people may think this is a bit old fashioned but I love it - it brings the mic closer to my mouth so when I speak, I sound MUCH better - This one is a KEEPER.</text>

The bonus was that I could hear him loud and clear as well.  The only reason I would only go 4 stars for this is that it is still a somewhat bulky geekey device and I have to turn the volume up with each call.  It does not seem to hold the setting?  Other than that it is truly a superior product.  I have purchased and returned at least 6 different types of these in the past but this one is a keeper for sure.  With the lawmakers all over the world making rules against cell phone use in the car its the only way to go.

        <text>Was skeptical when I read the raves about this newPlantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headsetwhen it was first announced. Am a heavy cell phone user, and spend quite a bit of time on the road and in environments where I need a good and reliable hands-free solution for communication. There have been a number of Bluetooth headsets released in many different price ranges over the past few years, and I've bought many of them, some of which now sit uselessly in the bottom of my electronics drawer.But this time the raves were right, as in my opinion, it's tuned out to be the best one on the market to date. Read on and you'll see why I came to this conclusion.First Impressions:Upon arrival, opened it immediately, as I had a good test scenario in which to use it the following day: walking around a noisy outdoor flea market. The packaging was excellent, and found immediately that the instruction manual was written in a very clear and concise fashion, with easy-to-follow text and good illustrations. Followed the directions and charged the unit for the suggested 30 minutes before first use.As it was charging, looked carefully at the new Bluetooth headset and immediately thought that it might be uncomfortable, as the battery pack portion which rests behind the ear appeared larger than many on the market. I also wear glasses, and didn't think that it would be at all comfortable. Found later that I was quite wrong in both cases.After its initial charge, tried to see how easy it might pair with my often-stubborn cell phone, and exercise that has sometimes required a few tries. The Plantronics Voyager PRO paired up on the very first try, which was a first for this user. Found that the standard medium ear tips were a perfect fit, and then tried each of the additional ones that came with the unit, settling back to the original. I wear my Bluetooth headsets on the left side, and found it easy to change in seconds by rotating the boom mike. After all of this was done, finished charging the headset for the suggest 1.5 hours to full charge.Trial Run:The following day was a Saturday when I was going to be visiting a busy outdoor flea market with a friend, and it seemed to be the perfect time to test the unit. The noise levels were as expected, so I tried making a few calls using free weekend minutes. The first thing that people with whom I was talking noticed was that the sound was so clear, better than they had ever heard from my previous calls, and this was even with a moderate wind blowing at times. Most thought that I was still home.Wore the headset into the early afternoon, a little over eight hours straight, and found it to be the most comfortable Bluetooth headset that I've yet to encounter... for the most part didn't even realize that it was there. Also found that it didn't interfere with wearing glasses at all, which is a strong plus for this user.Pros:* Great ergonomics, fits easily right out of the box.* Superb sound quality, even in windy conditions.* First-rate controls for power, volume and call control.* Automatic voice prompts alert battery &amp; mute status.* Excellent and clearly written instructions.* Non-proprietary charger port (micro USB).* Up to six hours of continuous talk time, confirmed.* Single charge standby of five days..Cons:* None. Can't find a single one so far... another first.Regular Use:The Plantronics Voyager PRO has become an item that I use daily, which I couldn't say about my old Bluetooth headsets, including my old basicMotorola H505 Bluetooth Headset, which had actually served me quite well for a couple of years. The Voyager PRO is far more comfortable and ergonomic than the photos might indicate, something that one can only find by actual extended use. Have worn mine for 12+ hours a day at a time, and it's been quite easy to adapt to over extended periods of time, with no discomfort whatsoever. I ride a mountain bike some distances over suburban streets and wooded trails on a regular basis each week, and the first thing that callers notice is that the sound quality is excellent, with no wind noise reported by anyone.Suggestion:Did some checking on the Plantronics site (just google Plantronics Voyager Pro) and found that if one registered the unit, the company would send out a free car charger. The site said: "Purchase a Plantronics Voyager PRO headset and register your new product to receive a FREE power charger for your car." So I registered mine, and within about a week received it and received another pleasant surprise in that the quality of the free car charger was as good as the Voyager Pro. So be sure to register your unit if you get one of these.Summary:Have had this unit for over a month now and have subjected it to more use than the average product that I might review here. Looked carefully to see if there were any flaws or omissions in the product or its performance and for once just couldn't find a single one.Kudos to Plantronics for bringing such a product to market, for it satisfies the Bluetooth headset needs of the demanding user such as me.  A true 5-star offering, without a doubt.[UPDATED]I would have kept this Voyager PRO Headset for years, as it perfectly satisfied all of my needs, but I had an accident with the one reviewed here, so when I had to get a replacement, I decided to replace it with thePlantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headset, as it had been recommended by a friend as a reasonably priced alternative. That was a mistake, putting it simply, and since then have replaced the Plantronics Voyager 520 headset with the newerPlantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headsetearlier in 2012, and recently posted a review on it, as can be seen in the notes here. The Voyager PRO+ was a logical move considering my personal needs, though whether it's any better that the Voyager PRO remains to be seen. I'll gladly keep answering questions on the older one as much as possible, as I've been doing all along... and thanks to all of you who have tracked this review.4/17/2012</text>

        <text>In my experience Plantronics makes quality products with well thought out design.I've enjoyed using this headset so far although I don't put alot of minutes on my headsets.  The toughest part with this headset for me was getting it working out of the box with my Palm Centro phone.  After I fiddled around with the instructions and the headset and phone I finally got it working.  Once it was working I will have to say that it is very comfortable for me and the sound quality is good.  This is better than my old bluetooth headset that is a few years old but then again technology in general keeps getting better.  If I had to give a wishlist item I would say give me a car recharger rather than a home plug rechargers since I tend to keep my headset in the car.  All in all, nice produce...I deducted one star for my initial setup tinkering.</text>

        <text>I bought this product in trying to find the best bluetooth option for talking on my cell phone when on business trips and away from my desk.  I needed a bluetooth headset that could be on my ear for hours and be loud and clear for listening as well as have a perfect microphone with background noise filtering for when I speak.  The Plantronics Voyager Pro is good, but not great from my experience with over 40 hours of using it so far.#1 The other reviewers are right, I had about a 1/4" long scruffy beard growing in and the microphone screen snags on beard hairs on your cheek badly, this was almost too painful to wear this device with even 3 day old scruff on your face.  The screen requires a foam cover if you have a beard.#2 the microphone is strong, but the noise filtering doesn't seem to work very well.  My callers can hear me fine but they can hear everything else in the background too, even distant noises like dog barks.  The wind filtering is medium and it gets pretty windy here.#3 the audio itself is too low, I had to switch to the lowest size ear buds so they fit deeper in my ear canal.  Even then with my phone at max audio volume, and my Voyager Pro at max audio volume the audio is only "just able to be heard" I really wish it could have pushed the volume louder to account for people who talk with soft voices.  I have had over the head 2.5mm headphones that provide louder audio volumes.Overall, the Plantronics Voyager Pro isn't a bad product, but for as much as it costs you would expect it to have better volume and to include a foam covering for the microphone for people who may want to grow beards.</text>

        <text>I've used the 510 for years to great success. But I am often leaving for home late at night from the office and my SO wants to stay on the phone with me until I get home. The walk from my office to the open air lot gets quite windy and he can never hear me then.The Pro seems to be quite an improvement over that.But I do have the following problems with it:1. It constantly falls off my ear. So did the 510 but not as often as the Pro. I must have small ears or something. But a slight head tilt or even just moving around quickly will cause the Pro to eventually dislodge and fall out. The little ear insert does not insert at all and the Pro feels constantly like it is barely hanging on.2. I still have the Razr -- waiting until HTC updates its Droid so it will have voice activation with Blue tooth (can you believe such an excellent phone would come out without that software probably one of the most important safety features when it comes to driving!?!) And I read in another review that the Pro won't stay connected to the Pro.Well I was already starting to have a lot of problems with dropped calls on my Razr - it is time for that phone to go -- but the dropped calls are almost non-stop with the Pro.  But that is not a reason not to get the Pro; it is my problem that I am still using an antiquated phone because none of the new ones appeal to me yet.But I still give the headset 4 stars for all of the positive attributes cited in other reviews here.</text>

This Plantronics Voyager Pro is one of the best I've tried but does have minor flaws.I keep giving these dual mic products 5 stars because they keep impressing me with their ability to improve audio quality.  I gave this one 4 due to a minor flaw that's a bit annoying for those of us with facial hair - the wind screen on the boom mic catches my beard and rips out hairs at least a few times a day!  Ouch!!  I've since noticed another reviewer mention the same problem so it's not just me.  If not for that, this headset probably would've gotten 5 stars.  But I can't deny the fact that using this headset is literally painful!The Voyager Pro indeed has superior audio quality.  I tend to be a bit soft spoken and I also work in an office with barking dogs, so being heard on the phone can be challenging.  No, this headset doesn't magically remove the barking dogs keeping only my voice for the caller to hear.  But a friend that I speak to regularly often complains about the shrill barking in the background.  It seems that headsets are so good at picking up audio that the dogs are amplified compared to what I hear live in person.  Anyway, this Voyager Pro does a good job of suppressing the barking and blunting the edge to the point where my friend can hear me loud and clear while the barking dogs are more tolerable on his end.  That's the advantage of dual mics.Dual mic technology is really popping up everywhere.  The results speak for themselves, literally!!  Every dual mic product I have is superior to every product I've tried with only 1 mic.  The comparison isn't even close.  I've made the analogy before but it's worth repeating -- dual mics are similar to the mechanics behind having two eyes and two ears -- dual mics offer more dynamic range, depth, clarity and have the ability to drastically improve call quality in headsets.  I'll never go back to single mic products again.  The difference is that significant.The boom mic on the Voyager Pro positions the dual mics closer to my mouth and callers say they can hear me loud and clear, as if I were in the next room.  And call volume on my end is equally loud and clear.  I credit that to Plantronics established reputation with headsets.Buttons are responsive and the unit itself feels sturdy.  I appreciated getting extra ear gels and foams too.  Always helpful when trying to get a good fit. And the headset itself does fit comfortably.  The boom makes it a bit larger than others but that's to be expected, but it's still light and I really don't notice I'm wearing it.My only other quibble is that my phone supports voice activated calling but there's no way to access it from the headset controls.  With other headsets, pressing the call answer button activates voice commands on my phone, but with the Voyager Pro, all I can do is answer a call or redial the last number dialed.  A bit of a let down for a product with the "Pro" moniker.  But I can't complain too much since voice dialing is problematic in itself.  But still, it can be useful when driving and I'd rather have the option available to me.UPDATE -- voice dialing does work.  you just have to hold the call button a while for it to kick in.The Voyager Pro is an excellent headset but I still have to give the edge to the BlueAnt V1 as my favorite dual mic headset.  I like that the BlueAnt is voice controlled and also talks to you, giving verbal confirmation of everything that's happening, from connection status to incoming calls and the works.  By contrast, this Voyager Pro only confirms battery and mute status.  But for those who don't want more sensory overload in their lives, the BlueAnt might be overkill.  This Voyager Pro is on par, if not slightly better at noise cancellation and the boom is a plus since it gets the mics closer to my mouth.So if you don't have a beard, or scruffy 5 o'clock shadow for that matter, then you'll be happy with the Plantronics Voyager Pro. If not, you might consider shaving or the BlueAnt V1 instead.  Otherwise, be prepared to lose a few facial follicles.</text>

        <text>So the sound on this headset is really amazing. I have gone through quite a few bluetooth headsets and none can compare to this one. Occasionally it has some crackles; but nothing serious. It was seamless and easy to connect to my BlackBerry. It even works well when I was using it and riding my bike. The person I was talking to said it sounded windy, but it wasn't enough to bother her.The only thing I really don't like about this headset is the size. I feel like its 2001 again :p When I have it on and I get stuck in traffic making my 20 min drive longer, my ear starts to hurt. Maybe I have weak ears, but they are the only ones I've got. A quick remedy to this is to switch it to the other ear (the way the headset is makes this incredibly easy).</text>

        <text>I bought this because my Plantronics voyager 510 did not have very good noise cancellation when I was in windy conditions.This voyager pro did well when I was out for a bike ride on the weekend but no matter which ear bud or pad I use, it is nowhere near as comfortable for long term wear as the 510.The bright blue light from the 510 was dimmed a down and moved so it no longer makes the interior of my truck blink blue at night.The charger is different - I wish they would just give you a USB charging cable.</text>

        <text>This headset does, in fact, have great reception and clarity.  People have remarked on how much better they can hear me since I upgraded from my old Plantronics headset, and I'm able to hear them more clearly, as well.  The folding mic is a nice feature, and the device is easy to re-align from left to right.  Five stars for those features, but...One star for fit. I really can't stand this headset for frequent use, simply because the fit is TERRIBLE.  My old headset fit securely and so comfortably that I'd forget I had it on.  Not so with this one.  It regularly pops off my ear - even when I'm not moving - and is almost impossible to fit with sunglasses or computer glasses on.  If I wear it for more than a few minutes, I actually get sore both on the outer and inner ear (where the earbud fits), and switching earbuds hasn't helped.  I'm actually considering going back to the old headset, even with the poorer sound quality - or just switching brands.  Someone has to have a nice marriage of sound and fit, but it isn't here.</text>

        <text>I've reviewed quite a few bluetooth headsets over the years. This is the best one I've ever owned- bar none. People I've talked to say that it sounds like I'm in the same room as them. I have small ears and one of my biggest complaints has been that so many of the bluetooth headsets are too big and don't fit well. This one fits perfectly, and by design it should fit most ears regardless of size.The headset is very secure. I was so saddened when two or three bluetooths back I lost one after about a week. It was one that did not have an ear loop and it cost more than this one. This one will not fall off of your ear, and despite it's big size, it is very lightweight and has not caused me any pain even after using it for a week now.It charges with a micro usb plug, the same one my mouse, phone, and several other devices use. If you are looking for good, reliable sound quality and don't mind your bluetooth really standing out, this is a great choice.</text>

        <text>I've been through numerous headsets from a variety of manufacturers and have found Plantronics to always be at or near the top of the bunch since I first used their Discovery headset.I've also had a few cheap Motorola headsets that sounded like a tornado when trying to talk over even the slight breeze from my car's air conditioner, so the Voyager Pro's "WindSmart" claim is something close to my heart.Not content to use it to talk over something as wimpy as an air conditioner, however, I decided to put the Voyager Pro to the test by fulfilling a tech fantasy of mine: holding a conversation while bombing down neighborhood hills on my bike!The result was a pleasant affirmation of the manufacturer's claims. While riding I could hold a conversation with the caller on the other end (despite riding in a strong wind)!Reportedly, the sound quality was "okay" in the midst of airflow, and there was never a problem understanding each other. My old headsets would have crapped out at the slightest puff of air!I wouldn't actually recommend using the Voyager Pro while biking since the headset could bounce off your ear with a big enough bump, and I doubt the unit is designed to withstand a lot of sweat or rain, but the fact that I could use it under such conditions is enough to make me a fan of the product.The normal audio quality is great, as usual for Plantronics, and the "WindSmart" technology works well.You won't be disappointed with this purchase.</text>

        <text>This is a very good BT headset. One of the features I required was mute, so this was one of the few choices I had. I have also owned a Plantronics Voyager 520 and a Motorola H620. The Voyager Pro fits me much better than the H620. It is a bit larger, but having the weight on top and behind the ear makes it very unobtrusive and keeps it on my head. Controls are fairly easy and intuitive. Paired easily with both my phone and laptop. Sound quality is good, for both sender and receiver, as long as I keep it in my ear snugly. It is a flat ear tip though that rests on the ear eather than channeling into the ear like the 520. It does, however, come with 3 different tips which lock securely onto the headset. Battery life has been very good. Distance is excellent.</text>

        <text>Voyager Pro BT HeadsetSummary:Best headset yet! A little homely out of the box, but looks and works great once on your ear.Pluses:Good noise suppression - at least as good as my old JawboneComfortable on ear - lighter and fits better than it looksSounds great - very clear, better than many wired setsBattery life and charger connector (micro-USB)Easy right/left ear change w/o removing partsFolds more or less flat - Jawbone is more lumpyMinuses:The over ear portion competes with glasses a bitDetails:I am a very heavy cell phone user who spends a tremendous amount of time on the road both locally and internationally. Over the last month, I've used the PVP in a half dozen cheap cars (you know, the bottom end of the rental fleet), airports, outdoors, offices, etc. I'm just coming back from my second international trip with it and have to say that I don't want to use my most recent BT headset anymore. The PVP is now "it" for me.My former BT headset is a souped up Aliph Jawbone (original flavor). I had a silicone rubber insert for it custom molded for my ear since the original equipment wire earpiece and rubber insert for the Jawbone just didn't work for me. This was fine until I received the PVP. The PVP1. Sounds better2. More comfortable when compared out of the box3. Eliminates the tendency of the Jawbone to occasionally go into "sounds from outer space" mode4. Easier to fit in a coat pocket once folded (the Jawbone doesn't fold)5. Has non-proprietary (micro USB) charger port instead of the hateful Jawbone charger attachment6. Is more sturdy - the hateful charger attachment of the Jawbone tended to rip off part of the Jawbone when detaching it.7. Has obvious and useful controls for power, volume and call controlThe only issues with the PVP are that it looks a bit retro out of the box versus the still stylish looking Jawbone. I also found that it takes a little bit of fussing to deal with thicker earpieces on glasses and the PVP at the same time. I don't have any issue with my Jawbone configuration in particular because of the in-ear custom silicone piece. The standard J was worse, actually, on my ear using its standard wire piece.Conclusion:If it fits your ear, buy this one.</text>

        <text>I've used 4-5 headsets, including the Jawbone, but the Plantronics Pro blows them all away.The audio quality is great, and audio level (on both ends) is far louder than any other headset I've used.  It's similar to holding the phone itself.I was able to comfortably communicate when I was working in a computer room with a lot of fan noise.  It was easier to talk to someone on the phone than someone 4 feet away!  One person on the phone didn't even realize I left the data center. Noise suppression was that good.The headset is larger than most, but I actually like that.. harder to lose. My only complaint is about the USB charging port;  while it is a standard one, it's not as common as some other plugs.If something happens to my headset, I'll be getting another immediately.  I've never said that about any other BT headset.</text>

        <text>Seller did an excellent job and sent the headset right away. I am very pleased with the seller and the service I received. However, this headset does nothing to impress me. The battery life on this blue tooth is way TOO short! I thought I was getting a better replacement for my old Motorola blue tooth that finally died after 6 years, NOT!! We've owned several blue-tooth and this one is a big let down. Not only can you NOT put it on your ear and enjoy an entire day out without the thing going dead, everyone I talked to said I sounded "muffled" at times. I drive an 18wheeler and this headset captures too much background noise. I only give this an average score. I let my teenage daughter have this one and I am looking for a better one.</text>

        <text>This is by far the best headset I have used. Folks can't tell that you're on a headset, and that is what you want.  Very clear, verbal directions spoken are very nice.

        <text>The ear loop part is wearing apart and soon it will break into two pieces. The product itself is not bad, but the size of the headset is somewhat large and this model does not have the accidental call lock button. I found myself pocket dialing when the bluetooth headset is in my pocket. Another issue i came across is the random disconnect on bluetooth connection. Sometimes i would loose the signal on my headset but my phone thinks that i am still connected to the device.Overall, this is not too bad for $65. The quality is clear and loud enough to talk and listen to music while driving.</text>

        <text>The sound quality is the best I have ever experienced.  I switched to this headset because of what I heard regarding comfort of wear.  Most bluetooth headsets irritate my ear to no end.  I love the convenience of not having to hold the phone in my hand, but the pain is often unbearable.  This headset may be a bit obtrusive to some, but if its comfortable, that's what is most important to me.  As luck would have it, it is confortable, it does sound great and it was very affortable.

        <text>This is an awesome headset.  The sound is perfect both for me and for whom I am speaking with.  Easy to use, easy to set up, a truly wonderful product.So, why am I giving it 4 stars instead of 5?  I'm rating this 4 stars because when the headset is in my ear, the microphone touches my face!  I have moved it around, tried to position it differently and everything I've tried has failed.  Eventually, while I'm wearing it, the microphone will end up leaning against my cheek.  I'm bummed because this is the best headset I've ever used, but I can't stand it touching my face.I also have thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headsetwhich I LOVE.  I've had it for a couple years and it's my favorite out of the handful of headsets I have.  After much wear and tear from me, it's still going strong.  It also has great sound and it's very comfortable to wear.  AND it doesn't touch my face when I'm wearing it.I'm going back to the 510 as my primary headset and I'll use this one as my backup headset...</text>

        <text>This is my 6th different Bluetooth headpiece that I have owned and it is the first that everyone didn't say it sounded like I was talking into a tin can with strings!  It took only seconds to set up.  I wear it all day long.  It is so comfortable that sometimes I forget I have it on!  This model uses the best of both worlds in its design.  In the past, I always thought the "over the ear" designs were most comfortable but I often couldn't hear well while driving over the road noise.  Wearing the "in the ear" design, I could hear well but couldn't stand to wear it for extended periods of time.  This design puts the speaker in my ear so that I can hear excellent but the thing isn't jammed in my ear.  The battery sits over the ear and is balanced perfectly.  I am not technical enough to talk about dual mics and special electronics and software.  What I can tell you is that my customers can hear me well and I can hear them well.  Isn't that the ultimate goal???  This is the Bluetooth headset that you need to buy!</text>

    <sentence id="9812">
        <text>This is my first Bluetooth device, and as such, I am at a disadvantage to be able to compare or relate to a previous wireless experience. But I believe there is no need, following my faith in a long history of using other Plantronics equipment, I have always considered this brand to be the standard by which others shall be measured anyway.This unit does not disappoint, It is attractively designed and solidly built. Some may find it too much of a fashion statement, but I think it looks really cool.As a first time user I found the controls simple and easy to learn- my hands are still learning to find them without distracting my brain while driving, not an easy task.I do not use the phone when driving very often, but due to the CA law about driving without a hands-free devices, it was inevitable that I would take a call the old way just as a police car happened by. No notice, no ticket, but I decided to start using one of these anyway. I purchased a corded $1.99 Ebay unit, it is a horror but usually gets the job done. I was sure that between wrestling with the cord and trying to get the mike in the right place it was more of a hazard than just holding my phone.  I would expect anything would be an improvement after that, and the Plantronics seems to simply do everything perfectly.I found it a bit hard to get into place initially- especially while driving- but once it is secure, it feels natural and I scarcely notice it's there. Sunglasses with bulky temples are a bit of a problem too, but once you settle it a little it's not that bad. I do not suggest trying to put it on while driving in this fashion, with time may come more familiarity but it is almost the same as putting on a high-end hearing aid.Audio quality is loud and clear, even around town with the windows open. The quality of the mike was apparently different enough from both the phone's and my old wired set that I had to re-record my voice tags, but that was the only inconvenience. I made a few calls and a couple of people said they would not have guessed I was on cell- probably because they were.I also phoned various answering machines and voice mail so I could listen for myself, in most cases the quality was nearly indistinguishable from a landline call. This is primarily how I use my phone while en route in any case, I find a conversation- even with a hands-free device- should deserve a motorist's full attention.I tried it out on the Bay Area's 511 traffic call system, and I have never has such success with a voice-recognition system in a noisy moving vehicle, radio on and windows open.In one noisy stretch of road I had to cup my hand over the mike but that was it.I look forward to a long and satisfactory relationship with this device.LATER: Alas, this was not to be. When my wife's original Motorola earpiece died, my Plantronics mysteriously disappeared. I can't believe she'd taken it, but I did notice an almost immediate improvement in voice quality.About two years later, after daily use, it finally failed- broke at the little swivel beneath the earpiece. It is, in my mind, a testament to a great product that she immediately went out and bought the exact same model. And it's still going strong.I am anticipating the arrival of Plantronics latest and greatest, we will soon see how they stack up.</text>

        <text>I had high hopes for this device, but ultimately I am buying a new device b/c this one is inadequate. I'll just list the pros/cons from my experience of using this device on a daily basis for almost 4 months. I use this device with the Droid Razr Maxx.Pro:* Good wind noise reduction when outside* Pairs very easily with the devices I've tried.* Reasonable battery life - I can talk for 4 or 5 hours in a day with no problems.Cons:* Bad sound quality: I get reports from listeners of echos, clipped speech and low sound volume regularly. I know it's not the cell service b/c when I switch to the device directly listeners say "Ah, that's much better now."* Bulky: it's fairly big as a device around the ear, so wearing sunglasses and this device isn't great.* Annoying: After fully charging overnight, the device will report "battery medium" after about an hour of use. To make it worse, it actually says "Battery medium" in a British female voice during a call, causing me to miss words of the other party. *This cannot be disabled.*UPDATE: I purchased the expensive Bose deviceBose Bluetooth headset Series 2 - Left earto replace this one, and while it has a worse battery life, it charges quickly and the sound quality is tremendously better. I use the bose device all the time and have finally found a bluetooth headset I can rely on.</text>

        <text>I bought this headset to replace my old Plantronics Voyager.  It's a huge improvement.  I hear callers very clearly.  Those I'm calling hear me very clearly.  The dual mics definitely decrease the amount of background noise.  I have a friend who is partially hearing impaired and he can hear me the best when I'm using the headset - even better than through the mic on my phone.  I can mumble softly and people hear me.  I get no complaints about wind noise walking to my car.  The battery is lasting me about 5-7 days between charges.  As far as comfort is concerned, I have large ears so the way it came out of the box works fine for me.  The range is substantial as well.  I can walk a good 10-20 feet from my phone and there aren't any problems.  Some of the additional features, like the double click to re-dial, are nice.  I like the voice prompts as well.  I think its comfortable, clear, loud and all-around a great headset.  I'm very happy with it.  [I'm using this with the HTC G1 phone from T-Mobile].</text>

        <text>There are two types of Bluetooth devices these days; the ones that aspire to be worn like a piece of chic jewelry (e.g. the Jawbone), and the ones for "serious" business users where people can tell from afar that you're on the phone with an important client.  The Plantronics PRO falls into the latter category; and you can easily tell it means business from the metallic gray, black and stainless colors of the headset.EXTERIOR DESIGN:  It's a functional and sophisticated looking piece of equipment, with the speaker piece adorned with small holes, not unlike the barrel of a machine gun.  The set feels well-built, and the underside is equipped with a micro-USB connector, which is handy.  Recharging only takes about 1.5-2 hours for a full charge, and the buttons along the exterior are placed for easy reach.  They have a nice tactile feel, and respond well.  Their method for changing the ear pieces (which come in three sizes, small, medium, and large) is brilliantly simple- if only other BT manufacturers adopted the same scheme.  It's just a simple twist/lock mechanism, and earpiece adjusting is very easy.COMFORT:  This is where the Plantronics set gets a docked star.  It's very uncomfortable for eyeglasses wearers, and you'd think that they would at least consider the population of business users who wear glasses; cmon, not everyone has 20/20 vision or wears contacts.  There is an easy fix for the set that Plantronics should've adopted, especially for a headset of this price- allow the earpiece to telescope.  That alone would have helped fit the set to a variety of misshapen ears (like mine).  There is rotation, but just not telescoping.OPERATION: The set syncs easily with any BT equipped phone, and operation and range were flawless.  I appreciate the thoughtful feature where a computer voice warns you of a low battery; it's much easier to check the battery status with the warning voice than take off the set and check the flashing status lights.The most touted feature of the set is the wind resistance, and I must say that it works well in most conditions.  There is virtually no wind noise when the wind is blowing parallel to the microphone (for instance, in a car).  However, there is perceptible wind noise when the wind is perpendicular to the microphone, and blowing directly into it.  Fortunately, there is an easy fix for that- just rotate yourself such that you are parallel to the wind direction.CONCLUSION: All in all, a very good set.  If you don't wear glasses, then I give it 5 stars, and you should buy the PRO immediately.  If you do wear glasses and headset comfort is an issue, then you might want to consider other sets.  If you do wear glasses and you often talk at the top of buildings or in front of a giant fan, then you should buy the PRO immediately.</text>

        <text>This was probably the most comfortable bluetooth headset I have ever tried. It fit snuggly in my ear and was not in danger of falling off. I have had bad luck with headsets in the past where the person could not hear me very well or I had trouble hearing the person.This was pretty simple to use and most of the calls I had no problems with. The only thing is that I got occasional sound issues where it was staticy or it would break up randomly. And this is when I am sitting in the same spot.The buttons were a little bit hard to hit at first but after using it for a bit, they are in an easy spot to press.One more thing, I had trouble pairing it with my Palm Centro at first. But then I updated my firmware and it worked beautifully. So for anyone who are having trouble pairing, try to update the phone first.</text>

        <text>Simply said, I love plantronics. Have used them in the office and at home. However, I'm getting tired of this series and their stablity with those of us that wear glasses. Felt ok first month or so. However now, even when trying different earpads, it just won't stay stable if using all day during work. I'm disappointed by the lack of stablity in my ear, as i'm constantly trying to push back in the ear so it doesn't feel like it is about to flop out.Good performance, mediocre stablity. I'm getting one that allows a "headband" next time, as I just don't like these "secure behind the ear" only types.(have had for around 2-3 months now)</text>

        <text>I've had a number of bluetooth headsets over the past several years, and this one is my favorite, by far.Soft gel inserts prevent chafing on the inside of your ear, and the hook design places the majority of the headset's surprisingly light weight on the outside of your ear--a good thing, as both my wife and I have noticed the inside-ear-mounted BT headsets seem to cause us discomfort over extended use.Incoming audio quality is impeccable.  Outgoing audio quality is as good as it gets; small air turbulence (such as the air conditioning in a car) have little/no effect on conversations.  Background noise is greatly reduced.Best yet, the strength of the signal appears to be much stronger than most headsets; I can place my BlackBerry on another side of my body, or even the car, without hearing "clipping" noises or having choppy audio.As another reviewer mentioned, if you have facial hair, the windscreen on the mic can catch an errant follicle.  Beyond that, that's really my only gripe with the headset.After a solid four weeks of use I highly recommend this headset--especially if you tend to experience pain or discomfort using inside-ear-mounted headsets.</text>

        <text>Owned this unit for 4 months now.  Have been very happy with it.Pros:- The mic on this is very sensitive and picks up my soft voice with no problem.  I've had to use a wired headset for years because I have not found a bluetooth unit (until this one) that can pick up my voice from where they sat near my ear.- Very good noise cancelling technology.  Listeners can't tell that I'm driving in my noisy truck!  Everyone thinks I'm on a landline.- Long battery life.  I leave this thing in my truck for use while driving.  So far, I've yet to run out of juice and I only charge it about once a month! (It's probably because I turn it off when I'm not using it.) My wife has to charge her unit about once every 2 days.Cons:- The body of this unit is pretty big and doesn't leave much room on your ear for sun or reading glasses.  Luckily, I don't need glasses to drive. If it wasn't for the size, I'd have given this 5 stars.</text>

        <text>I bought this for two reasons: the comfort and the clarity. Probably the the most comfortable headset I've owned and stable too. The clarity is very good for the most part, but the advertised wind cancellation feature is not exactly as good as they promote. It does a better job than others, but is still an issue with windows rolled down. Overall, an great product which I would buy again. No problems so far with holding a charge as another buyer had reported.</text>

No one I called heard the wind or the noise.It is not perfect.  My voice has a slight tinny sound.It looks big, but is so light on my ear and the bud rests slightly outside my ear canal, so there is no irritation.I also use the Plantronics 520, which is excellent as well, but slightly noisier in my fan test.I read about the flimsy reviews about the PRO, but found it to be something I can throw in my briefcase and use on trips with no problem.</text>

        <text>This thee best Bluetooth Headset!  Out of all the models I've ever owned this one is number one!It's easy to set up, however for some reason my cellphone did not recognize the initial pairing up the first time. However on the second attempt it did.I like to wear the  bluetooth on my Left side (personal preference) and out of the box it comes ready to wear on your Right ear.  To change it, (instructions are in the box, also on this) you slide the boom up and rotate it to the other side, then slide the boom back down.  Easy enough once you know what you're doing  :-)Then the ear piece itself must fit inside your ear or else you will not hear good.  There are various size pieces and directions are included on how to swap them.  I did not have to swap them, so I was lucky here.  But it looks easy, twist it then pull.The charge is good. Seems to hold for a good week.People say my voice is real clear on the bluetooth and I hear others talking clear.My favorite feature is what I call the "wind" feature.  The "wind" feature is unique here against other bluetooths were with other bluetooths and if you're in the wind people have a difficult time hearing you, yet you don't know it unless they say something.  However with this Voyager Bluetooth you can hear the wind as your party hears it so you can turn until you're away from the windy position.  It's very cool!Range is good, however that's not an issue for me as my cellphone is near or on me always.People seeing you wear it may think you just got off the Star Trek Deck *grin* due to the extending boom along side your cheek, it's well worth it!</text>

        <text>When it comes to calls This unit is a boss! I get no mention of wind noise or any background noise from callers. I can hear callers well and I have volume to spare. I have yet to hear any distortion witch is great but it may also be due to the narrow feq range this headset seems to use. Lows and highs fall off quickly witch isn't much of an issue when talking to people.Really, all this headset was made for was calls. It does a great job of it to. That said, music will sound boxy and is lac luster over all. I do use it to listen to music as I do my work waiting for the next call. While it does perform the task, it does it about as well as a transistor radio.The headset is comfortable. Surprisingly, the main body that houses all the heavy gear (battery and electronics) is almost unnoticeable. The different ear buds give you a lot of fitment range, but if none of them fit right, you can add one of the pillow covers to fine tune the fit.The one ding I will give it in the comfort dept is the mic angles in and rubs my cheek. I do not have chubby cheeks either. This is at least in part due to the swivel stop. It just will not swivel far enough away</text>

        <text>These actually do work for the iPhone's capacitative screen, which is not pressure-based.  Not just any plastic or rubber will work on those, unlike the resistive touch screens which work by physical pressure.  Some cheap pens which are labeled as being iPhone compatible actually are not, but this one is.However, the rubber used for the tip of this stylus (possibly out of necessity due to the touch sensor type) is very sticky and not good for swiping or drawing.Also, the rubber tip is actually a bubble and not solid, which makes it squish down very easily.  If you hold it at 45 degrees like a pen and push down with more than a light tap, the bubble can squish flat and the edge of the metal tube can hit the display.</text>

        <text>These styluses are cheap enough so worth a try I received 2 and one worked better than the other on my iPhone 4 and iPad 2 though both look the same. It's a hit and miss really. If you're just tapping a smartphone you will probably be happier than if you bought it for your iPad.Smartphones have smaller screens so this stylus despite its non-responsiveness to some taps, does a better job than your finger for selecting web links or playing some games. It's not too great for writing or sketching but still more precise than a finger on a smartphone screen. For an iPad you have more surface area and your finger works pretty well, so you will be more frustrated when repeated taps on the glass bring no response.Once again, it's a hit and miss with the quality so you may get a decent one or a bad one which is not too great. Not bad if you want to keep them in a couple different places like your car, office etc. They can come in useful in the winter when you don't want to take off your gloves.</text>

        <text>I am the owner of an original Jawbone bluetooth headset and was not very impressed with the product, especially after reading the "hyped up" product endorsement on it's website (it was false advertisement at best and down right deceptive trade practices at worst). But since my first bluetooth headset was a gift, I didn't really loose any money out of my pocket, so the sting of the false advertisement wasn't a big factor in me giving Jawbone another try.I must say that the Jawbone Prime is stylish, functional and has quality performance too. The sleek design makes it easy to "wear" the headset for hours without notice (you'll forget it's in your ear). I use the over the ear loop so the fit is perfect for me, but there are multiple ear bud sizes for those that want to forgo the over the ear loop attachment. The battery life is quite long and the reception is very good. People I spoke with had no problem hearing me even with my sunroof all the way open. I highly recommend this  product and in my eyes Jawbone has redeemed itself by finally producing a bluetooth headset that matches their advertisement claims.</text>
    </sentence>
    <sentence id="9857">
        <text>Here's how the last three bluetooth headsets went for me:1) Jawbone I - Really hate how it needed two hands to hook it on my ear and how it flopped around and was hard to get it to touch my face properly.  Buttons were extremely hard to press, especially when it was on your ear where it could be painful.  Made the mistake of putting it in my coat pocket where the ear loop broke off and in the process messing up the earpiece such that it wouldn't hold the replacement earloop.2) Plantronics 925 - I love this headset.  Really small/light with great selection of soft ear inserts for that perfect fit.  Easy to put in ear one handed.  Came with a custom hardcase so that no need to worry about breaking it in a pocket; bonus was being able to recharge the earpiece using the case's built-in battery.  Biggest drawback was noise cancelling performance.  I bought the Jawbone prime not because I didn't like the 925, but, because the Jawbone was 50% off when I bought it along with my new iPhone and two-year contract with AT&amp;T.;3) Jawbone Prime --I had to use an earloop; but, it's now easy for me to put the earpiece on my ear one handed.  Wish the various hard rubber ear inserts would have allowed me to use this earpiece without the earloop (since the earloop is vulnerable to breakin.)  Still not as secure as the Plantronics 925 in my ear, but, it's acceptable.Buttons much easier to push.Noise canceling microphone is excellent; no complaints.  This remains the biggest selling point for the Jawbone.Wish the speaker volume would go louder (similar complaint with the Plantronics 925).Biggest complaint remains the vulnerability of the earloop when the earpiece is not in use.So, I'm currently using the Jawbone in the car and bring the Plantronics 925 with me when I'm on the go (which usually means I'm not worried about road noise).If I had to chose between the two, I'd go with the Jawbone Prime; just avoid putting it in your pocket if you need to use an earloop.</text>

        <text>Pros:  Small size; sound quality; price; voice dialing works great; light weightCons:  Won't stay charged for very long; Even with the selection of ear pieces, I have a hard time getting it to stay in my ear without the ear loop but I have trouble with all types of earbuds so it's probably just me.</text>

        <text>I just purchased the Jawbone Prime with NoiseAssassin. It works great, in fact, it fit in my ear perfectly right out of the box! The volume range is great. After trying out the Plantronics Discovery 925 (which is very comparable to the JB Prime) I would definitely recommend the JB Prime. The Plantonics 925 felt like I had a rock in my ear. None of the earbuds fit right. Very uncomfortable! I returned the 925 and purchased the Prime and I'm glad I did.</text>

        <text>[Edit: after writing this, I took out the Jawbone again, reset it, fully charged it and tried to see if I could get it to work as well as others are claiming. In a single day over the weekend, I left it on and was only able to make it last just over one total hour of talk time before the battery died in the middle of a call. The total talk time was measured across three separate calls. This was over about 6-hours of total total "use" in one day whilst out and about. Same issues still with this one and the others I had. I'll try calling/returning directly to Jawbone and see what happens since it's paid for. If I could change my 'star' rating from a 2 to a 1 star during and edit, I would. Who knows, maybe the green one will work better.]This is probably the best looking headset available, but that's really where the positive comments stop. Well, not exactly, it's also very light and charges very quickly to reach full charge (&amp;lt; 1-hour).I have had three (3) Jawbone Primes and all behaved the same with one that simply stopped "working" after a few weeks. Why three? I bought one thinking it looked great and I loved what I had read (reviews as well as technicals on Jawbone's site). It simply was not living up to the sound quality nor battery life I expect for something in this category that I pay a premium price of $130 for. I returned it thinking something *had* to be wrong with it. The second was the same and just quit working after a few weeks. I thought, "OK, this definitely has problems so I'll try again and get what I thought I was paying for." No go. I returned it after a month.You might be reading this thinking it's my phone or environment. I would think this too, but I rotate between three distinct phones regularly (I go through phones more often than headsets). I used them on Nokia N97, G1 Android, and iPhone 3GS. Also, I linked to my computer for Internet calls. The environment varied from sitting at home and driving in a car to office and outside.First, the earbuds were too "mushy" and none fit right - the phone was always slipping so I bought a set of Plantronics earbuds. This fixed that issue.Second, The sound was not great. Many I spoke to complained about the sound. On my end, there was nothing special regarding call sound that I couldn't get in units half the price. The noise cancellation was no better than a Nokia BH-703 or Sony (forget the model right now) that I own. Since this is their claim to fame, I did test this thoroughly in various noisy environments, particularly with the Nokia BH, switching between the units. Wind, train, traffic, riding in a car, TV and others. It was not any better and in some cases worse. Yes, I was carful to make sure I had the Jawbone properly fitted with it touching my face appropriately.Third, the battery life on all three was simply poor. Unlike others, my experience was that it did not live up to the 4.5 hour talk time claim. I have meetings I take on the phone frequently that are one to two hours in length. Without exception, using a full charge to start, each unit would last about an hour. I had one go to 93-minutes, but only once. With light use and leaving on all the time, I had to charge daily. This was bad to the point I found myself wondering how much battery was left all the time. This is bad user experience. Speaking of charging, this is where it actually does great. Less than one hour charging on a completely dead battery and full charge is back. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean much.Fourth, the Noise Assassin button was problematic. All three had problems with it sticking and being pushed in so much that it lost it's raise so I had to push very hard to get it to work: not good when you don't use the strap (or even if you did for that matter). I also had a problem changing modes frequently when I was simply trying to cycle through the volumes.Fifth, no dedicated power button, but this I could have lived with, but the light that indicates state was under my thumb making it difficult to know if on or off. I inadvertently left the Jawbone on many times when I thought I held it long enough.Sixth, Jawbone documentation and web site state holding the power button for 3-4 seconds for power on/off as well as when putting in pairing mode. Try about 10-seconds and you'll be closer.Seventh, I had to hard reset all three of them more than once.Eighth, I just forgot what this was, but it's good. Oh, now I remember, it's a big pain to remember the various button presses, holds and combinations to get the various functionality (call answer/hangup, volume, noise assassin on/off, voice call, etc.)Ninth: I am contemplating if this is the worst aspect: the sound is terrible. A lot of static/noise that I notice and people on the other end have trouble hearing me. It's persistent regardless where I am (inside, outside, car, etc.). Sometimes it just disconnects from the phone (bluetooth just drops). I'm pretty sure my pocket or hand are not over 33' away from it. Neither issues are apparent with other, lesser expensive units.You're probably bored reading this by now. What fascinates me is the fact I went through three of these and used with many devices and always had consistently bad experience yet this does seem to get some good reviews and the unit is popular. I don't think I'd pay $60 for this, but I might because of looks and lightness. However, it is simply too much work, problematic and poor earbuds (costing you more money) for the premium price.</text>

        <text>I live in NYC, and as everyone knows its noisy here.  This headset sounds better than the actual phone itself because it cancels background noise very very well.  The battery life seems pretty solid to me,  I talk often and haven't had it run out during any 24-hour period (it gets recharged nightly).  It connects quickly, and once you get used to the buttons using it becomes second nature.Bravo, and great price too!</text>

        <text>I've tried all the newest Jawbone products starting with the ERA, which I tried 3 before giving up on that, I tried the Icon, also tried three of those and still didnt have the Noise Assassin as advertised in the commercials,then I tried the Prime and it totally lives up to Jawbones claim to fame of the Noise Assassin. I'm a truck driver, and I drive an older, not so quiet rig,so noise cancelling is what I'm looking for most when I shop for a headset along with a comfortable fit. The Jawbone Prime provides both, the noise assassin actually works, I've been able to talk on the phone, while driving down the road at 65mph with the radio on and the window rolled down, and the person on the other end only hears me and nothing else. The Prime also has plenty of volume too, I've had to turn it down cause its too loud, which is usually just the opposite for me on most bluetooth devices. I have worn this thing for as long as ten to fourteen hours a day, and most of the time I forget its even there, and with the earloop its an extra sense of security as not to lose it. The Jawbone Prime doesnt have all the fancy bells and whistles that the ERA and Icon have, but it lives up to its noise assassin that Jawbone has prided itself on since its debut.</text>

        <text>My original Jawbone was a wonderful headset.  Clear, understandable and others could hear me clearly.  When I lost that unit, I went back to Jawbone.The only model available was the Prime.  Its performance just doesn't measure up to expectations from the Original.  The Prime is fine for me to hear, but the microphone is terrible.  The first unit went back under warranty because the static from the mike was so bad.  My wife used it to demonstrate to me on another phone how bad.The replacement unit (I had to pay to return the first unit) had a slightly different but similar issue.  Still no one could hear me talking and what they did hear sounded like an echo.  The Jawbone service techs were polite but said all they could do with the second issue was to refer the question to 'the front office,' who have not responded in over a month.Folks in the phone stores recommended other manufacturers for BT headsets.  I should have listened.</text>

        <text>Good News: Audio is above-average and pairing is rock-solid.Bad News: Three (3) Design Flaws...Design Flaw 1: ButtonsThe combination power/activation button is a major design flaw.  My device turned itself on and off (or activated my phone) over and over.This is a problem for many reasons, not the least of which is battery life.As others have mentioned, pressing this button (even accidentally) can end calls.  Ont eh Jawbone ICON, the button was relocated to the back - a "stroke of genius" according to owners of both devices.The issue is that it doesn't take much pressure to activate the button.  Even if the Jawbone button is facing outward (that is, not touching your leg but rather touching your pants pocket), it is enough to click the button.Others have also complained about the separate volume button (it cycles; there is no up/down rocker).Design Flaw 2: EarloopsThe second major issue (for someone like me who requires a loop) is the connection from loop to phone.  I've gone through three (3) of the leather loops and one (1) of the plastic loop displayed on/with the device on the product page.  The connector just snaps after 2-3 weeks of use.  Customer support was initially rude and arrogant (requiring me to send back the broken loop), but after I provided a photo, they replaced one of the leather loops.Design Flaw 3: Removing ear rubber thingsAnd finally, the third issue is the ear rubber thing.  While you should never have to replace it, based on Design Flaw 2, I had to (a) remove it to get the serial number, and (b) change sizes to make the Jawbone fit while I awaited a replacement earloop.  This took 30 minutes and three people, before we thought we were going to rip the rubber piece in two.Aliph was in denial on these, but based on their actions (releasing the Jawbone ICON with an inner power switch), the combination button is clearly not optimal.</text>

        <text>I've had a couple of Bluetooth headsets before - both Plantronics. And while they worked pretty reliably, they cannot stand up to this new Jawbone Prime. I recently ordered the Plantronics 925 (liked the styling and color). But after reading the various reviews and watching the videos on the Jawbone Prime, I decided to give this a try. I am glad I did.I just got this today and I love it! The fit is perfect because of the variety of earpieces you have to choose from. I found the exact fit using the smallest earpiece with the little stabilizer loop. I don't have to use the earloop (thank goodness) - that was one thing that prevented me from trying the older version of the Jawbone. The Jawbone is so light that you can't really feel that you have it on. The NoiseAssassin works wonderfully. I made several calls today (to friends and to my voice mail) and the NoiseAssassin cancels out pretty much all of the ambient noise. And the people at the other end said that I sounded very clear.Couple of little things that will take some getting used to: (1)utilizing the hidden button or dimple (on/off, pairing) on the side and the button on the top (last number redial, volume, NoiseAssassin cancellation, call reject). Since it's hidden for aesthetic reasons, it's a little hard to find at first. Once you get used to where it is, it's not a problem; (2)determining what mode the earpiece is in (on or off) since the little LED light is so small and kind of hidden when you press on the side button/dimple. This is minor and just something to learn.Even with these two minor issues, I still give the Jawbone Prime 5 stars for call quality (especially the NoiseAssassin), style/workmanship, and ease of use. I will be returning my Plantronics 925. I wrote a review on this earpiece and will have to modify it after this.</text>

I don't even know where that thing is anymore...</text>

        <text>My husband drives a delivery truck, something that's not exactly cutting edge when it comes to noise control in the cabin area. With Oregon's new hands-free law coming into effect in January, we started searching for solutions in November.Our first try lead us to a wired earbud (he wanted to avoid the "middle-aged-guy-with-bluetooth" look if possible), none of these worked at all due to cabin noise. Next, we tried the PlantronicsPlantronics Discovery 975 Bluetooth Headset. Sound was clean and clear with this little sweetheart, he just didn't like the look and the buttons were difficult for his hands to operate, especially when wearing gloves.Next, we tried theBlueant 60-5151-05 Supertooth Portable SpeakerphoneWhich probably would be a great solution in a car or pickup truck, but did not work at all in the noisy cabin conditions of his truck, I believe mainly because the unit attaches to the visor, which is located much further away from the driver in a delivery vehicle than in a passenger vehicle. So, back it went, and next was the Jawbone Prime.I was hesitant to purchase this mainly for two reasons, one the design isn't very burly with its "pretty" wave pattern that sparkles when it catches the light, two I didn't know how well he'd be able to work the virtual buttons.Turns out the virtual buttons are perfect for his gloved hands, not requiring the precision demanded with the Plantronics and other headsets, the Jawbone is easy for him to use, pairs quickly and simply with his Motorola w385, and it's so comfortable he forgets he's wearing it.Sound quality is about the same as when he'd talk on his handset while driving down the road, there's still some road noise but his voice is easy to hear and he can comfortably hear the incoming caller's voice.He has many short phone calls during the day along with some longer conversations and he hasn't killed the battery during his 10-hour shifts.Overall, he is very happy with the Jawbone, now if they could just offer something that looks a little less "bling" for the old fellas!</text>

To me, it's a pain making a call, since you really have to pay attention when pushing the buttons.

        <text>I am lucky enough to be able to telecommute from home full time, and I spend fully 8 hours a day, every day, 5 days a week, on the phone. I put headsets through the wringer.  Over the past 5 years, I have tried many different headsets, both wired and Bluetooth. With some, the earbuds were too big, hurt my ears, and gave me a perpetual headache. Others didn't stay on, fell out, and were easily lost. Some just weren't hardy enough. My younger daughter, as a toddler, found them easy to pry apart and rip out the internal wiring. (I lost two Jabras that way...sigh.) And with wired headsets, the wires just plain get in the way, or they get tangled, or they (again) are very tempting for little fingers.Well, I am happy to say that after 18 months, I have just purchased my second JAWBONE BLUETOOTH HEADSET; this time, the JAWBONE PRIME.  (Yes, even the JAWBONE wears out with constant use.)  I am really thrilled with the JAWBONE PRIME; it is even better and more impressive than my first one, which was a JAWBONE II.  I, personally, love these JAWBONE headsets. They are compact, unobtrusive, easy to wear, easy to use, and fit me beautifully.  And, if possible, the JAWBONE PRIME fits even better than the JAWBONE II.The JAWBONE PRIME stays in my ear, no problem, and is so light weight that I barely notice that it is there. It comes with 6 different earbuds sizes in two different styles and two earloop styles. The smallest bud and the padded loop are perfect for me. I have tested the fit by jumping up and down, shaking my head around, chasing after my children at full speed, and doing cartwheels (yes, cartwheels).  I have taken my glasses on and off multiple times and even brushed my hair.  The headset stays in. I find it very easy to use the hidden buttons; after all, I watched Lt. Uhura do it for years on Star Trek. Hold the button for a few seconds to turn the unit on or off, tap it once to answer or hang up calls.  Easy as pie!The sound quality is great; I can hear everyone and everyone can hear me. And the improved fit really makes a huge difference in the sound quality.  With the JAWBONE II, there used to be a trick; you had to make sure that the voice activity sensor, which activates the NoiseAssassin, was touching your cheek near your jaw. It was easy for the older model to creep away from your face. Not anymore.  The new and improved JAWBONE PRIME hugs your face.  I don't even check for contact any more.  It is just there.  The JAWBONE PRIME really works reliably every time I put it on. I am heard clearly, with no ambient noise.  I have tested the NoiseAssassin in the car with road noise, with the radio on, with screaming children, with another phone ringing in the back ground.  No hears anything but me.My JAWBONE PRIME BLUETOOTH HEADSET is small, sleek, and silvery; it is practically hidden beneath my hair, but looks very professional when seen. Overall it fits my lifestyle perfectly, both professional and personal. It may not be the headset for everyone, but it sure is the right headset for me.</text>

        <text>I've got aBlackBerry Bold, as well as an iPhone 3G. I'm not writing this review exclusively for comparing the N97 side-by-side, but given the price of this phone, the bar is set reasonably high. Obviously, nothing's really "as good as" a BlackBerry when it comes to e-mail (and you're using a BES), and nothing available right now is "as good as" an iPhone when it comes to web browsing or application availability. So for reference, those weren't taken in to consideration.The N97 arrives in a very nice package, with a pre-charged battery and thoughtfully written manual. The included software doesn't run on OS X, so I spent very limited time working with it.Within a couple of minutes of receiving the box, I threw my SIM card in and the phone was happily asking for some settings. What impressed me immediately, is that the N97 seemed to know exactly how to configure itself for data and MMS services. This is the first unbranded phone I've used that didn't need me to enter the settings for my carrier (AT&amp;T;).The N97 almost instantly showed a strong 3.5G signal, and started filling the home screen with information. I placed a couple of test calls, and was extremely impressed with the sound quality. Without question, this is one of the best sounding wireless phones I've ever used.And then, the wheels started to come off...First task: sync my work mail, contacts, and calendars via ActiveSync.This started out reasonably easy, until I realized about halfway through the wizard that I had entered a setting incorrectly. Unfortunately, once you have something in the wizard, it's there. There's no "Back" button. So, the Mail For Exchange program started complaining immediately."No problem" I thought, I'll just change the settings. This turned out to be far more convoluted than it should be. "Options" doesn't give you a path to the settings. You have to go to hit the silver button, then go to Applications, then go to the "MfE" folder (which is incredibly cryptic, if you don't know what you're looking for) to change the settings.Once I had them changed, the N97 happy started grabbing everything I wanted from my Exchange server. I went back in to Options and saw some well thought out options, like setting "prime time" for a constant sync, and a schedule for when you don't need instant access. There were also options for setting Out of Office notifications, and the overall experience was quite good.Second task: set up my personal e-mail account.Having used the wizard already, this was straightforward. The program asked if I wanted to connect to get my mail, and I confirmed that I did. Mail showed up, and all was good. Until I tried to leave the program. That's when I learned that the N97 is apparently incapable of maintaining two mail connections.Annoyed, but willing to accept this limitation, I tried to put the account on my home screen, along with my Exchange account. Apparently, the N97 can't do this, either. You can have one mail box on the screen, regardless of the number of mail accounts you may be using.Third task: connect with my Bluetooth speakerphone.My car has a Bluetooth speakerphone. Since I can remember Bluetooth being a feature on wireless phones, Nokia seems to have dominated this space by including just about every Bluetooth profile under the sun. Pairing the N97 wasn't a problem. After it was set up, I made a couple of calls (which again, had awesome clarity) and thought everything was fine. Until...When I returned to my car later in the day, I noticed that calls weren't being directed to the speakerphone. As it turns out, the N97 won't re-pair with anything on its own. So while I could use the speakerphone with my Bold and iPhone without doing anything at all, the N97 requires you to hit the silver button, then go to Setup, then Connectivity, then Bluetooth, then Paired Devices, then pick the speakerphone, then hit "pair" every time.Speaking of which...Fourth Task: answer the stupid phone.I'm not 100% sure this is even possible with the N97. When the phone rings, you have a large bar with an arrow that points to nothing, and is labeled "Answer". If you tap it, nothing happens. If you hit the green button, nothing. If you unlock the phone and try either, nothing.Feeling like a complete moron, I had to look it up. It turns out, the bars are sliders, similar to the Unlock slider on an iPhone. Yet, this is really the ONLY thing in the OS that acts like an iPhone.Fifth Task: get Facebook working.This wasn't difficult at all. Enter your name and password, and go. The application looks similar to the BlackBerry version, which I happened to like more than the iPhone version.It does just about everything you'd expect it to, until it crashes. Yes, that's right. Until it crashes. Constantly. Sometimes it does a full "I'm kicking you back to the home screen" crash, and other times, you get a red box telling you that your phone needs to be restarted. Sometimes the red box goes away on its own. There's really no rhyme or reason to it.Sixth Task: read my e-mail.Well... on the first try, I had a message that said my phone was out of memory. You see, despite having 32GB of storage for music and movies, the amount of memory your phone can actually use for programs is quite limited. The out of memory message suggested closing other applications, which I did, and which resolved nothing. Rebooting the phone worked.That's when I discovered that the N97 is actually quite awful at rendering mail that isn't plain text.That's also where I started to give up on the N97. In between all of this, I also discovered that:*Your choices for incoming message alerts are either at the same volume as your ringer, or disabled.*Some things need to be double-tapped, others single-tapped, with little indication as to which is which.*The Ovi Store is basically a kludgy mess.*The keyboard will constantly register any key that you so much as brush your finger next to when typing.*There is virtually no connection between what the battery display chooses to tell you, and how much battery life you actually have.*The N97 is basically a hopeless mess of a phone.Admittedly, there are some bright spots:*The back camera takes surprisingly good pictures.*The included weather application is actually pretty cool, since it uses GPS and updates often.*The overall build quality of the phone is quite good.And sure, there are a boatload of hacks and tweaks you can make to the phone to get it to do things closer to what you want. But in my estimation, the amount of research and effort to do so is unreasonable, given this phone's cost.I've also heard that a new software update is imminent (as of this review, the most recent version available for this phone is 12.0.24), so that may solve some problems. But with the N900 not costing substantially more and a release date "any day now", the N97 is for Symbian fans only.</text>

        <text>[This is an updated review; some of the issues that existed when the N97 was first released have since been addressed.  Also, I have moved some of the more elaborate details of the original text into a new review ("A Guide") that I created for thewhite version.]Nokia E- and N-series phones have for some years now had, by far, more capabilities than anything else out there - but they have not always been the sexiest or had the widest mass appeal.  Plus, although Nokia sell more smartphones than anyone else worldwide, they have not targeted or marketed the US market very heavily (thanks in part to our combination of non-standard wireless technologies and frequencies, consumers' focus on style over substance, and Nokia's unwillingness to cater to the fairly heavy-handed branding and crippling of functionality demanded by US network providers).Much of that is changing with the N97.  As you can see it definitely has the visual appeal.  Also, its main enhancements over the most recent N-series phones (such as theN95,N96andN85) are user interface centric:&gt;&gt; 640x360 WVGA LCD&gt;&gt; Touch screen&gt;&gt; QWERTY keypad&gt;&gt; Faster CPU (ARM11 at 420 MHz vs. 332/369 MHz in the N95/N85, and two ARM9 cores at 265 MHz in the N96)&gt;&gt; Configurable widgets for the home screenThere are a couple of other improvements as well:&gt;&gt; 32GB of built-in storage, SDHC card slot for up to 32GB more (Nokia always advertise only the tested configuration, 16GB)&gt;&gt; Additional sensors: Magnometer (electronic compass), ProximitySo, yes, Nokia have finally bit the dust and moved onto the post-iPhone touch screen bandwagon.  But whereas Apple borrowed quite a few UI elements from theMotorola Ming, and other manufacturers in turn tried to copy the iPhone look and feel, Nokia has taken a decidely different approach: They have taken most of their new design elements from their ownInternet Tabletsline (e.g. exchangable home screen widgets, keypad layout, etc).  They have also done so while keeping the underlying OS from their previous smartphones, Symbian/S60.I don't care much for this direction.  To this day, I would take theE90any day over the N97, had it been released with support for North American 3G (UMTS) bands.  The E90 does not have a touch screen, but does have a numeric keypad on the outside in addition to the QWERTY inside the shell -- this allows you to "type" with one hand using the native T9 predictive input, and mostly keep your eyes elsewhere while dri... eh... walking.As it is, Nokia ended up with touch screen phones (starting with the 5800 XpressMusic) kicking and screaming - it kindof shows.  The user interaction paradigm is a little odd at times -- probably mostly due to the S60 legacy. [Lipstick/pig joke deliberately omitted here]. For instance:&gt;&gt; You need to double-tap on icons (once to select, once to open)&gt;&gt; They still retain "soft keys" on the side to access menus an the like (though now they are located on the display itself, and occupying quite a bit of space).  The home (previously "standby") screen has three soft keys; the left and middle are always "Options" and a a dial pad, while the right one is configurable ("Contacts") by default.There are some other usability issues with this phone as well:&gt;&gt; Copy &amp; Paste functionality is a bit more cumbersome.  There are no keypad shortcuts; with the keypad open, cut/copy/paste are only available via the menus!  Moreover, not all text input screens have such a menu available - in which case you need to close they keypad in order to bring up a virtual numeric keypad with a context menu at the top of the screen.  Or, if you use an external Bluetooth keyboard, you can press Ctrl-X/C/V.&gt;&gt; The keypad layout is a little unusual at first.  The navigation keys are on the left (which some gamers like, but I don't).  The space bar is in an odd location on the right.  Mixed alpha/numeric input is cumbersome because the digits 0-9 are "shifted" via a key on the right side of the keyboard, while the standard shift key is on the left.  Plus, in some dialogs you get a helpful numeric keypad on your screen, but it defaults to text input (2=abc, 3=def, etc) rather than give you quicker access to digits! (Why, Nokia?  You already have the keyboard?  What are you thinking?).  That said, the tactile feedback is good, not too "firm" or "clicky", but with a good feedback.&gt;&gt; There is a nice E-mail status widget for the home screen, but you can only have one of these.  If you have multiple e-mail accounts (e.g. for work/home), you can only monitor one of them.  The same goes for some of the other widgets too.&gt;&gt; Direct media controls are gone (the N95/N96/N85 had a dual slider design giving ready access to play/pause/previous/next).  There is a home screen widget available, but it is hardly as convenient (e.g. if you are using an application, typing a mail, etc).Some other limitations that I found so far when compared to their previous N-series phones:&gt;&gt; The amount of available RAM (dynamic memory) available for applications is low (around 55MB, versus about 75MB in the N85/N95).  UPDATE 2009-07-01: This may not be an issue after all. With the latest firmware update from Nokia, the available memory seems to have increased to about 65MB - and in general, the only time I have had a "out of memory" error was while running RoadSync, which explicitly warns that it is not compatible with this phone.&gt;&gt; Adobe Reader is no longer included in the price of the phone. It is still preinstalled, but now only on a trial basis.  If you want to continue using it after some days (about 3 weeks I gather), you need to purchase it - similar to QuickOffice.&gt;&gt; The number of applications available for this phone is somewhat more limited; this is only the second Nokia phone to use the new S60 5th edition user interface w/touch-screen support.  Although most of the older applications will still run on it, there may be some that don't.  Notably, Nokia Internet Radio is not included,  nor is it available for download yet. :(&gt;&gt; Synchronization of phone contacts/events/todos is not yet supported on the Mac, as Nokia have not as of the time of this writing released an iSync plugin for it. (You can still synchronize with Microsoft Exchange, use the built-in "Switch" application to copy contacts from another Nokia phone, or you can transfer contacts as vCards from another phone).&gt;&gt; Getting Bluetooth Stereo Audio (A2DP/AVRCP) to work with your Bluetooth car stereo is hit and miss.  More on my experiences in this regard in the "white" model review.&gt;&gt; The UI is generally a bit "sluggish" - moreso than my previous phone, the Nokia N85, despite a faster processor.  The touch UI probably has a lot to do with this.  (Then again, both the N95 and certainly the N96 did not break any speed records by any stretch of the imagination).All that said, most of these issues are software/firmware related, and will improve over time.  As it is, the N97 is perhaps the most capable phone on the planet today -- a jack of all trades, if you will.  It certainly has improved over previous N-Series phones in a number of ways as well:&gt;&gt; E-mail reading is dramatically improved - especially in clients with HTML support (e.g. System SEVEN). Also, because most of these integrate into the "Messaging" application, messages are listed much more nicely in the mailbox -- the larger screen is used very well here.&gt;&gt; Web browsing - what a pleasure. This was the main attraction of the iPhone - but I think the N97 surpasses it. Kinetic scrolling, variable zoom, and quite a speed improvement.  Of course the previous strengths are there too - the way the "Back" button brings up snapshot views of your previously viewed pages, Flash, etc.&gt;&gt; The phone has quite a "solid" feel to it, without feeling like a tank.To be sure, there are phones out there with better cameras (e.g. Samsung Pixon), more newbie-friendly user interfaces (iPhone), better support for a variety of corporate e-mail standards (Blackberry), and so on - but hardly any that have the combination of all these features in one device.  The closest may be the close cousin Samsung Omnia HD, which:&gt;&gt; runs the same OS, has the same screen resolution and many other features&gt;&gt; has a better camera (yeah "megapixel blur" but also optics), HD video recording&gt;&gt; faster CPU (600 MHz vs 420 MHz)but:&gt;&gt; does not have good support for U.S. 3G frequencies, and&gt;&gt; does not have a keypad (QWERTY or otherwise).These two shortcomings pretty much kills the Omnia HD as an alternative for me.Also, aside from the N85, the N97 is the first Nokia phone to support tri-band UMTS ("worldwide" 3G).  This means that you will get 3G speeds (mostly) where they are available: 850/1900 MHz for AT&amp;T; Wireless and other carriers in the Americas, 2100 MHz elsewhere (including Japan).  That said, for complete worldwide coverage you would need "penta-band" UMTS, with the additional inclusion of 900 MHz for Europe, and 1700 MHz for T-Mobile USA.  No phones currently support all of these bands.  NOTE: There is also a "standard" version of the N97 for international markets, with support for 900/2100 MHz internationally and 1900 MHz for roaming in the Americas.You probably won't see this phone subsidized on contract by a carrier anytime soon.  The primary candidate would be AT&amp;T; - but it looks like they have passed on it (perhaps they don't believe it has mass market appeal).  Then again, if you are looking to get this phone, you are not likely to be the type of person who would accept their lockdowns in the first place.  Look no further than the differences between theunlocked Nokia E71versusAT&amp;T;'s E71xfor a prime example: In AT&amp;T;'s version, various features are disabled (keyboard shortcuts for copy&amp;paste;, the S60 native e-mail reader, network selection), and instead a number of non-removable, non-renamable, non-movable AT&amp;T; specific applications are installed.Another upside of buying an unlocked phone like this is that it may cost you less in the long run.  It seems I'm unable to get actual numbers past Amazon's editors here (see comments) - but if you have a standard SIM from AT&amp;T;, you can plug it into this phone and add a standard "data unlimited" feature.  In contrast, if you get a smartphone on contract from AT&amp;T;, your data plan will be at least twice as expensive - which adds up over the 2-year contract term to cover (at least) the price difference between most of these and the unlocked N97.  Plus, you would of course not need to renew your contract with an unlocked phone like this.  AT&amp;T;'s generally subsidize their phones a couple of hundred bucks versus the unlocked equivalent (except the iPhone, where the subsidy is closer to four hundred, but where the more expensive data plan is mandatory).Finally, if you take your unlocked phone with you abroad, you can walk into a store and get a pre-paid SIM -- that way you local tariffs, rather than pay (outrageous!) roaming fees to AT&amp;T.;Now for a couple of practical aspects and caveats:&gt;&gt; If you are looking for a unique look, go for the white model, not this black one.  Some also think it is better looking.&gt;&gt;If you are going to use the N97 in your car, to play music or for GPS turn-by-turn directions, do yourself a favor and get a cradle/mount for it.  For instance, there is a Brodit cradle (available from ProClipUSA) specifically designed for it; this is one part of a two-part mount, the second part will be specific to your vehicle; you can get one from either ProClipUSA, PanaVise, or Pro-Fit International - they are all compatible.  Or, if you want a universal holder, the Bracketron Grip-IT works nicely for the N97, and can also be put on the same vehicle specific mounts.Finally, if you are looking to get this phone, it is important that you get it for the capabilities, not ease of use.  Like other Symbian/S60 phones, getting used to it takes a little persistence and discovery, but it will grow on you over time as you explore it and learn more about its esoteric features.</text>

        <text>So I started using this phone about 5 or 6 months ago and have recently come to this decision to ditch it for a Nokia E75. I will list the pros and the cons I think that the Nokia N97 has....pros*Nice and eye-catching design....Many friends really liked the look of the phone and the sliding keyboard really excited some people*Satisfying web browsing....It has been really nice to look at some much-visited web pages and do some shopping online with the phone, most web sites load quickly and fully*Nice camera*Pretty decent music player....I used this phone with a 16GB card full of music as my primary head-phone music player most of the summer*Large screencons*widgets are a mixed bag...most of them are not really useful and would not connect consistently*"lock key" on side of the phone has been a real pain....sometimes it would work, then not work, then not unlock, get stuck, etc*the touchscreen is just soooo not smooth and slick. I would often wonder if I had pressed something hard enough or not hard enough.*QWERTY keyboard is not very easy to use. The "character" button is right next to the "space" button so I was CONSTANTLY calling up a page of characters at the wrong time, which really slows down typing*on screen numeric key-pad is ok for T9 typing but very clumsy.... I am a very heavy texter and this got so frustrating for the amount of backspacing and deleting for most text messages*not pleasing photo gallery....the biggest problem I felt with this was just how unattractive it looks. I once had a Nokia N85 and the way it displayed the photos was very streamlined and neat looking. This device just lays them all out with no styling and also near the end of my using the device it would take so long to load that it got kind of embarrassing if I were trying to show someone a photo*general bulkiness of the device*high price tagand finally I just got tired of it turning off unexpectedly, re-booting itself, not being able to unlock it with the lock key, etc.So, as you can see it really isn't a bad phone. It just fell way short of my expectations for a Nokia "flagship" phone and also as a touchscreen device. I ordered the E75 out of sheer frustration and the desire to get away from a touchscreen. I've only had the E75 for a few days but in spite of the smaller screen, I now have a smaller, easily pocketable phone with a VERY VERY VERY nice QWERTY keyboard and a traditional keypad for T9 texting. Very happy with my new phone and kinda glad I don't have to deal with the frustration of all the N97's inconsistencies. Thanks for reading!</text>

        <text>I have owned Nokia phones my whole life.  This phone is nothing more than a N95 with a touch screen and poor integration.  There are many bugs in the code right now.It has a chance to become a great phone, but wait till the first software update to see how much time &amp; effort Nokia is going to put into it, right now you are best to hold off.UPDATE: I returned the phone back to Nokia, Too many software inconsistencies, some screens you double touch (click) others you only touch once. Some screens you have to use a scroll bar, others you just drag your finger to scroll down. I don't want to have to learn which screen do what and change my habits depending on the application/menu I'm on. Nokia should have taken the time to make all their apps and menus work the same. I would understand that 3rd party applications might be different but not the installed applications on the phone.This phone really needs to be in your hands for a day or two to figure out the frustrations with it. Don't get me started on the poor use of memory and how if you are not a Nokia user from a long time ago, you install your apps on the default drive only to figured out the default drive is not where all the memory is. Or if you get tons of text messages it fills up the C: drive and you-the owner- have to change system settings to tell TXT MSG'ing to not use the default drive.Search the web for N97 to read and see the YouTube videos of why not to buy this dumb phone - um I mean smart phone.</text>

        <text>I am a big Nokia fan and really liked my 5800 and 5530, so I was quite looking forward to playing with the N97. This is a exquisite piece of hardware, the feel of the device is the nicest of any phone I have owned. But the software is really showing its age, even compared to newer, cheaper Nokia phones.Nokia really are asleep at the wheel, the 5530 shows they can do reasonable job of making a touch phone using S60 but they have let their S60 flagship lag far behind other S60 phones that are less than half the price. I gave both the 5800 navigation edition and the 5530 XpressMusic 5 stars based on the great usability and incredible value, but the wonderful N97 hardware is let down by old software.Good:- Wonderful hardware.- Excellent call quality- Very extensive feature set.- Very nice screen in sunlight.- White color looks great.- Nice keyboard (except space bar).- 32GB internal storage.Bad:- Home screen lacks scrolling contacts of 5530.- Inconsistent touch menu (some double, some single tap).- Very small space bar.- Mediocre browser.- Weak FM transmitter (not powerful enough for car use).- Ovi Maps lack search (you need to have google maps installed too).- No in-line spell check.Don't even waste your time comparing this phone to true smartphones like nexusone, droid or iphone 3gs, its just not in that league software wise, only price wise. When you see what google and apple have done so early in the smartphone game, it really is a shame for Nokia. Such great hardware let down by such bad software. And before you say N900, I had one and returned it, maemo shows promise but is far from ready for primetime use and the hardware is a brick.If you have lots of money, already like Nokia S60 phones and have never used an iphone or droid you should love this phone. Everyone else steer clear of it, looks at the 5800 or 5530 if you wanna go Nokia.</text>

        <text>This is a follow up on a review I wrote for theblack versionof this phone ("Beauty and Brains, Together at Last"), where I covered more of my initial impressions, including some of its pros and cons.  Here I will go into more detail about certain discoveries I have made using the phone for a little while.I should probably first mention again, though, that in all honesty this not the phone for everyone.  In particular, the user interface is a bit quirky (inconsistent, and not always as responsive) - and it does take a certain amount of persistence to explore and appreciate all the features and capabilities that this phone offers.=== Hooking up to your car stereo ===Chances are that one of the first thing you will want to do is to set this phone up for handsfree use and perhaps streaming music over your car stereo.  Doing so is going to be hit or miss.First, it would not work in "Bluetooth Audio" mode (i.e. to stream music over the A2DP Bluetooth profile) withPioneer DEH-P7000BTunit that I had installed in my car, and which worked perfectly (albeit after a Nokia-specific firmware update from Pioneer) with my previous two phones, the Nokia N85 and Nokia N95 -- though it worked fine as a handsfree unit in "Bluetooth Telephone" mode (over HSP/HFP).I went through several car receivers (both buy/return and in store) to get one that actually worked:* ASony MEX-BT2700(works fine, nice intuitive controls, but inferior sound and also inferior handsfree pickup),* AClarion CZ509(complex controls -- I had to download the user manual on my N97 right in the store in order to figure out how to pair it; would only work in "Blueooth Audio" mode and NO SOUND would come through in handsfree mode)* AnEclipse CD5030(very nice unit, good sound, integrated steering wheel controls for Toyota and Honda; but same problem as the DEH-P7000BT: No A2DP/AVRCP with my phone)I skipped on Kenwood, because from prior experience using a KDC-X492 along with a KCA-BT200 adapter, there was a delay from when Bluetooth Audio were initiated from the phone until it was heard over the speakers. This may seem like a nitpick, but I also use my phone as my GPS/navigation system - and the result was that instructions like "In 400 yards, turn left" would become "n left". No dice. The Pioneer unit, at least, did not have this problem.I did finally find something that works for me: A newer Pioneer unit, theDEH-P6100BT.  From my original unit, I also knew that this one has excellent sound quality and controls (good dynamic range, good sound shaping features, etc).  The one problem I'm still having though is that each time this unit connects to my phone, it initially gives me only "handsfree" functionality (not stereo audio). I need to manually go into the menus EACH TIME and enable A2DP and AVRCP (that's quite cumbersome), OR start playback from my phone (in which case A2DP, but not AVRCP is enabled automatically).  In other words, getting my steering wheel controls to do what they are supposed to do - control the playback - is usually more hazzle than it's worth (except for longer trips).All this said, a Bluetooth-enabled stereo is not necessary with this phone.  If you have an auxillary input or a tape deck in your existing car stereo, you can hook up to its 3.5mm jack using a standard auxillary cable or a cassette adapter.  You should then dock your phone close to your driver's seat (I use aBracketron Grip-ITholder until a N97-specific holder is available from ProClipUSA), since you'll be using the internal microphone when making calls.  (I actually got better sound as well as better handsfree pickup with this setup and my factory stereo compared to the Sony I mentioned above).  You will need to use the phone itself to control music playback (as opposed to the receiver or steering wheel controls) - but that's why there is a "Music Player" widget available for the home screen.EDIT: If you read the N97 specs carefully, you also know that it (like the N85 before it) has an FM transmitter.  I did not even bother to mention this initially, because quite frankly, I don't see the point.  It is far too weak to produce the signals required for your typical FM receiver, even as the antenna is fairly close.  All you get is static.=== Tethering (phone as modem) ===A little known fact about GSM/GPRS-enabled phones (except the iPhone) is that they can be used as a modem for your laptop orother device, e.g. while on the road.  You can connect via a USB cable (one is included in the box) or Bluetooth.  In fact, if you have a Mac from the last 3-4 years (e.g. MacBook Pro), it will automatically set up this modem connection when you pair it with your phone (There is a checkbox that says "Access the Internet with your phone's data connection").  For Windows, you can download modem drivers from Nokia's support site.You will need an Access Point Name (APN) from your cellular provider, as well as a dial-up number (often optional), username/password (ditto).  This information is readily available on the Internet.  It should be noted that such tethering is NOT included in the price of many data plans, unless they specifically state so (this is why it is not enabled in the iPhone as sold in the US) - and it certainly would not be wise to use this as your main internet connection.  I find it invaluable for light web and e-mail access on the occasional road trip though.=== Downloading Applications ===The N97 comes with a number of third party applications preinstalled, including JoikuSpot, which allows you to turn your phone into a WiFi access point for internet access; Adobe PDF, QuickOffice, and even an Amazon app.  But of course one of the primary joys of owning a smartphone like this one is being able to continuously explore new applications and uses.The N97 runs the "Series 60" User Interface, 5th edition (a.k.a. S60v5) on top of the Symbian operating system version 9.4.  S60v5 is the first version of this platform to support touch-screen input, and this is only the second phone from Nokia to do so; previous N-series devices (such as the N95, N96, N85) all ran on S60 3rd edition.This means that even though the N97 represents a new type of device for Nokia, it is mostly capable of running applications that were written years ago.  Many of these are being updated for the new touch platform, to be sure, but the main outcome of this backwards compatibility is that you will find some pretty esoteric stuff out there.  For instance, I make frequent use of Salling Clicker - an application that lets you use your phone as a remote control for your (Windows or Mac) computer (over Bluetooth or WiFi), e.g. media/music control, powerpoint presentations, etc., even though that application is not specifically written for the new platform.  I also use the PuTTY telnet/SSH client, which HAS been updated to take advantage of the new touch screen, but otherwise was developed long before the N97 (or even the iPhone).  Then there is Nokia SportsTracker - always invaluable; keep it open while you go jogging, biking, etc; you can later view your route superimposed on a map, speed plots and summary, and even what music you were playing at various times.In addition to Symbian/S60 specific applications, and like most (non-US made) phones, the N97 can run "generic" mobile applications written for Java (J2ME).  For instance, Opera Mini is an excellent and super-fast web browser that can run on most mobile phones (not the iPhone, Palm Pre, BlackBerry though) -- thanks to its use of proxy servers that compress the traffic sent over the air to your phone.  I myself got a kick out of a HP 45 calculator emulator I found recently, which uses the original HP45 program code and even has a picture of it. :)As you can guess, the applications that you can download for the N97 are not concentrated in one location, as they are in the iTunes App Store for the iPhone.  This is a fact that Apple exploits very well in their own marketing - and to be sure, discovering or searching for applications is unfortunately quite a bit more cumbersome for Symbian/S60 than for the iPhone.  On the positive side, that means that there is no central control (you know, where someone decides that there shalt be no third party web browsers, mail readers, or GPS/navigation apps).  In fact, it is this very open architecture that allows the "write once, run everywhere" paradigm of the J2ME platform, whereas Apple, RIM/BlackBerry, and Palm/Pre are only capable of running applications that are specifically written for those devices.Now, Nokia has had a "Download!" service for years, and have recently opened an expanded application store, the "OVI store".  The content is still somewhat meager in both places; moreover, as I found by trial and frustrating error, once you have purchased and downloaded an application from the OVI store, there is no way to re-install it (should you happen to uninstall it at some point).  I was attempting to get a newer version of RoadSync (a Microsoft Exchange client with very decent HTML support) working, but because it got into a state where I wanted to re-enter my Exchange Account information, I had to reinstall.  (This is also an issue in RoadSync -- there should be a way to reset the information without having to uninstall/reinstall).  However, the original installation package was never saved on my phone, and there was also no way to download it without purchasing again.  For me it was thanks, but no thanks - both to RoadSync (poor design) and OVI store (poor design).The bottom line is that if you expect to be fed with a teaspoon from a central app store, then maybe the N97 and Nokia's infrastructure is not for you.=== Cohabiting with the Mac ===The N97 comes with software for Windows, but not for the Mac.  Well - that's standard fare.  Unlike most mobile phone manufacturers, Nokia have at least developed software for the Mac. :)You will want to download two things from them for ANY of their phones: Nokia Multimedia Transfer, and an iSync plugin.Nokia Multimedia Transfer is a background application (access it via a little menu bar applet) which allows you to, well, transfer multimedia between the Mac and your phone when connected via USB (using the "PC Suite" mode on the phone).  It imports captured photos and movies from your phone camera into iPhoto, synchronizes selected playlists between iTunes and the phone (transcoding any movie files that are not natively supported on the phone in the process), and allows you to synchronize web bookmarks between Safari and the phone's browser.The iSync plugin WOULD let you use iSync on the Mac to synchronize contacts, calendars, and todo notes with the phone.  Unfortunately, almost a month after initial release, there is not yet any such plugin available for the N97 -- frustrating since they already have one for the N86 MP, which has not yet been released here.  In the meantime, you can at least transfer contacts from your Mac Address Book to the phone: Select all contacts (Command + A), select File -&gt; Export -&gt; Export vCard; transfer the resulting "vCards.vcf" to the phone (E:\Other\Contacts), then open "Contacts" on your phone to select "Options -&gt; Copy business card -&gt; From other memory".How to do the latter, you ask.  Well, once you have paired your Mac with the phone, you can browse the phone filesystem from your Mac by clicking on the little "B&gt;" (Bluetooth) icon in your menu bar, then selecting the phone, and then "Browse device...".  You can also simply send files from here, or from right-clicking on the file itself and selecting: More -&gt; Send &amp;lt;filename&gt; to ...Finally, as mentioned above, you can use your phone as a modem by simply pairing it over Bluetooth.  Or, you can plug in the USB cable, then open the "Network" System Preferences pane.=== The Copy/Paste snafu ===Unlike previous S60 phones, there are no keypad shortcuts available for Copy/Paste on the N97.  Instead, you need to access these functions in the menus ("Options -&gt; Editing Options" in most places).  The problem is that not every input field has such a menu available!  For instance, if you are entering settings for a new e-mail account, or the WEP/WPA/WPA2 key for a wireless access point, you are working inside a pop-up dialogue box with no menu available.Ridiculous as this sounds, in these places you actually need to CLOSE the keypad, then tap on the input field in order to bring up the virtual numeric keypad, as if you were using multi-tap or T9. On the top of this screen there is a context menu -- if you first drag to select the text you want to cut/copy, then those two options are available in that menu; if there is text in the clipboard, "Paste" is available.Or, you could use aBluetooth keyboard-- more on that below.  In this case, Ctrl-C/X/V works as expected.=== Laptop/Netbook Replacement ===You laugh.  Go ahead.If you are an owner of any other recent N-series device (N95, N96, N85), you already know that it can hook up to a TV using the included TV-Out cable, CA-75U.  Well, the N97 does not come with such a cable, but you can order one separately and it still works.Also, while the N95/N96 come with a "Wireless Keyboard" utility pre-installed, it is not included in the N97.  You can download and install it from Nokia's web site though; go to the support pages for their own SU-8W keyboard.  It will complain that the application is not compatible with this phone, but it will work anyway.So, there you have it.  QuickOffice is already pre-installed to allow you to view Microsoft Office documents - you can purchase an upgrade that allows you to edit these documents too.  Adobe Reader LE is also installed (though note that unlike on previous phones, it is now only a trial - you have to buy it after 2 weeks or so..).Personally, I access remote UNIX hosts over SSH using PuTTY.  Obviously you can also do web browsing, mail reading (incl. Microsoft Exchange), etc.=== Reaching Nerdvana ===Just to be exceptionally clear on this point if you haven't figured it out yet - this is a phone for geeks.  People who follow Boy Genius Reports, for instance, best stick to their iPhone and the eye candy that is afforded them there.  It takes a little bit more persistence to appreciate S60 devices like the N97 - but in return, it will grow on you for a very long time as you keep finding new features and new ways to use it.  For starters, the sheer wealth of hardware that exists on this device (5MP camera with flash and video recording, GPS, 640x360 pixel screen, pull-out keyboard, a hundred different types of sensors including electronic compass, accelerator and proximity sensor) are just ripe for new sorts of applications.</text>

After a little confusion in the part of set up (because SOMEONE won't read the instructions) we charged this bad boy up and he was chattering away.And then I discovered the wonder that I had never known... if he has the headset on - the rest of the babbling idiots are not cursing over my TV as the kids walk by.

        <text>I have my MiFi device about a month now and so far I'm really impressed - glad I went with the MiFi over the alternatives. I find I can just stick it in my backpack and I get hassle-free connections from my laptop or iPod, without anything to plug in or share, and in emergencies, I can even share my bandwidth with a few other people without sacrificing too much performance.I tend not to use the supplied Verizon software...Windows out of the box connects just fine, once you configure in the SSID and encryption keys. Only time I use the Verizon software is when the battery runs low and I want to use (and charge) the device from a USB port connected to my PC.As for performance, in my office (where I can see the cell tower just across the street), [...] reports amazing 3.0MB downloads and about 700KB uploads. This is the fastest mobile device I've seen. Unfortunately, I live in an area where there's spotty coverage, and from home I seldom see over about 500KB/200KB (down/up). This is with zero to one bar in the signal strength meter in Verizon's software.I have two small gripes: One, I'd prefer a way to set the SSID and encryption key manually. So far haven't found a way to configure anything other than the Verizon chosen settings. This makes me hesitate to share my bandwidth with coworkers I might be traveling with...in essence, there's no way to "revoke" it once shared.[UPDATE: Yes, this is possible to do - you just point the browser to the IP address of the MiFi itself, and there's a fairly typical web-based admin capability built-in that includes the ability to change the SSID, encryption type and keys, etc. Add an extra half-star for this, although it should have been better documented so mere mortals could figure it out!]My other complaint is something I suppose I should have thought about, but it seems to be a hassle (and expensive) to get the device working outside the USA. The rep mentioned something to me, but I didn't think about it until I was out of the country, and regretted not being able to connect.Still, if you want to be connected at broadband speeds - even across multiple devices - anywhere you can get a cellular signal, it's a great option.</text>

        <text>After being sorely disappointed from Sprint Overdrive, I turned to Verizon Mifi for my mobile internet access need. I did a round trip back and forth from Chicago to San Francisco with it powered on with at least one device connected 8-10 hours a day almost every day. I was impressed with good Verizon coverage &amp; stability of this device. Unless you absolutely need "largest data footprint", I highly recommend Verizon Wireless for your data need.If your work relies on internet access and you are a road warrior or travelling, do not rely on your hotel/motel's or coffee shop internet access. During my month-long trip, several places that I stayed had free wi-fi, but their signal barely reached my room. Mifi did save the day(night). In big cities, places with free wi-fi are usually overloaded with tons of users trying to watch latest video clips. Sure, if you are just using internet casually, $60/month may sound expensive. But if you need it for work, $60 doesn't seem expensive any more when you are on the road.If you ever decide to get this device, be sure to call customer support to block text message service unless you want a surprise. This device can still receive/send text messages. You may not aware of incoming message, but you'll have to pay for it if somebody sends texts to your number.I am hopeful for the 3.9G network that Verizon will launch in the future. But don't hold your breath as the technology itself is very new. It will probably cover major cities at first and will take several years to reach Verizon 3G coverage. If you need flexible mobile internet connectivity NOW, I say this Verizon Mifi is the best candidate.See + &amp; - for this device &amp; Verizon service below :+ Very stable device. Rarely crashes. (Sprint Overdrive crashes all the time.)+ For my requirements, albeit somewhat expensive, 5GB/mo is adequate.+ Relatively fast mobile connectivity. Fastest download I got was 2.5mbps in Yellowstone (Old Faithful). Typical is 500k-1mbps. Sure T-Mobile &amp; AT&amp;T; has the latest &amp; fastest technology, but their 3G coverage is abysmal comparing to Verizon. Verizon is also on a lower frequency band (then AT&amp;T;, T-Mobile and Sprint) which means it penetrates through walls and travels further. When using T-Mobile in Chicago, when I get into a building, it will just drop to 2G network. -- If you need mobile access in specific place and AT&amp;T;/T-Mobile has good coverage, go with them. You'll be much happier with faster connection. But if you travel quite a bit, you will appreciate Verizon 3G coverage. -- For me I just need fast enough internet access most of the time, rather than fastest internet access from time to time.+ Customer service is very efficient &amp; helpful. Try their direct line. Google "get human".- If you are connecting to corporate VPN, be prepared to get disconnected from time to time. Verizon shuffles your IP address while you're online once in a while. Once your IP address changes, most VPN will drop. (Be prepared to shell out $500 if you want static IP)- Mifi is slow to dish out IP address to your wifi devices. My Nexus One has trouble connecting to it.- This device has no external antenna port. If you are visiting area with bad reception (yes, when you are on the road long enough, you'll know Verizon has a fair share of those area), you just have to move the device around until you get better signal. It would have been much easier with external antenna.- While Verizon has best 3G coverage, it doesn't have the best "data footprint". Verizon does NOT roam on to other networks for data service. If you are unfortunate to be in the area where Verizon doesn't exist (Yosemite comes to mind, the ONLY provider their is Golden State Cellular), you have NO data access at all. --- If your work/livelihood depends on data accessibility, go with Sprint as you can hop on data service on other network.- Despite what the "Can you hear me now?" guy tries to imply. Verizon still has tons of dead spot, and several cities only has 2G coverage. But if you stick to main interstates &amp; no-to-small of a city, you usually have 3G.- This device is charger-picky. Do not expect to connect it to any USB port and it will charge. I've had success with Fry's $2 cigarette micro-usb charger, Kensignton laptop/USB charger.- With latest firmware update, device will act as a wirelss modem when connected to a computer. This means that no other devices will be able to access the 'net via Wifi.</text>

I have seen this behavior on my cradlepoint as well.I tested the device on my ipod touch while in a Walmart and the mifi in my pant pocket , it never lost signal and I had 2 or three bars (using safari to check the wifi page) , I was able to use the ipod touch in the store without any problems. Streaming radio using the ipod and bike riding was not a problem either.My experiences with 5gb limits on mobile bandwidth has been that it seems to be enough for normal use , in the car , at the hotel , a trip for a few days and just web surfing , streaming audio , emails ,etc... stay away from streaming video , downloading big files and you should be fine.</text>

Also, I stayed in Vegas at MGM for two nights, and have always used their $12.95/night wifi; not this time! No need, thanks to MiFi. What a great product. And I will use it when visiting my farms in IA and IL, where I stay "on farm" in my RV, in the boonies, and have been frustrated in past years, by lack of internet access.

        <text>I used this MIFi for more than 2 years.  After my contract ended, I kept using it, for 2 reasons. First, it worked really well, in that it always connected quickly to the Verizon network, as well as to my connected devices, such as laptop.  This was true all over the Washington, DC area, where I live, as well as throughout the country when I traveled.  Second, some newer models had really bad reviews (Amazon reviews really are handy).  Yes, some of the newer devices were faster, at 4G, but why would that matter if the device didn't work all the time, when you needed it?  So, I held on tight to this model, the 2200.Fast forward to a couple months ago when I gave the newest Verizon MiFi, the Novatel MiFi 4620L Jetpack 4G Mobile Hotspot (Verizon Wireless), a try. This MiFi was definitely worth waiting for.  It worked as well as the MiFi 2200, and at 4G was faster.One thing to be aware of (this may not apply to new subscribers): the plan I had with Verizon 2200 was a 3G plan.  With the 4620L, Verizon no longer offers this plan, and I had to upgrade to a 4G plan that was $15 more a month, with a higher data allowance.  I'm not using more data, on average, each month, so I am effectively paying $15 more a month with this device.  But, the data upload and download is faster, so I don't mind too much.In sum, if you want the latest and faster Verizon MiFi, check out the 4620L, which is also offered here on Amazon.Either way, you can't go wrong.</text>

        <text>The mifi has the potential to be a breakthrough product, but unfortunately it fails in its first iteration.While casual web and email users won't notice this, more complicated and data intense connections (such as connecting to a VPN) seem to overwhelm the Mifi, and it will drop the connection to Verizon's network and quickly reconnect.  While such behavior won't impact email or web browsing severely, it does force VPN users to have to reinitiate a connection and start over.  For business users it's effectively useless.This is not a problem confined to a single location either.  So far this behavior has occurred in multiple locations across four states even when there's a full strength connection to the tower.Another annoyance is the charging behavior.  Plugging the device into a USB port on a computer disables the wifi router and converts the device back to a traditional USB broadband access device.  What were the engineers thinking?  If the battery is running low you're forced to connect the old fashioned way to the network with bloated drivers and all of the annoyances that this device is supposed to eliminate.  Activation was a pain too as it required installing all of that stuff to get started.Words cannot express how truly disappointed I am in this product.  Even more so the fact that both Verizon and Novatel are completely silent on the disconnect issue.  There's a good discussion on the Verizon messageboards that describes the problem (and many users' frustration) in greater detail.UPDATE -- 10/24/09Novatel and Verizon released a firmware update for the device in October.  I haven't used it enough to make a judgement as to whether or not this improves the situation, but some users are reporting better device behavior.  I'll report back when I learn more.Unfortunately, Mac users are out of luck on the firmware update.  The device will only update with the Windows version of VZ Access manager.  If you don't have Windows running in Parallels or VMWare you need to take the unit into a Verizon store for an update.  Quite a hassle.UPDATE -- 10/31/09Unfortunately the firmware update does nothing to address the problems I indicated above.  I have had no less than three disconnects with the device in the last 30 minutes, and I am in sight of the tower!  I again repeat the above cautions.  This device is not for professional use.</text>

        <text>I have had a Verizon Wireless MiFi Broadband Router for about weeks now and felt it was time to share my real world experiences and thoughts on the device.  In three words: IT IS GREAT!What is it?  It is basically a Verizon Wireless EVDO card in a small casing that acts as a Wi-FI Router and allows for 5 simultaneous devices to connect to it.How does it work?  The MiFi is like any other router, on the underside of it you will find a SSID and a WPA Security key so you can connect any of your devices to it via wi-fi.  If you dont have a device with wi-fi y ou can plug it into your computer via usb and use the VZAccess Manager software to gain connectivity.How big or small is it?  Simply put, it is the size of a Kit-Kat bar.Battery Life?  I charged it fully for testing purposes and connected my blackberry 8900 and iPhone 3g to it.  My commutes are usualy about 4 hours round trip per day and thus this was the best way to test the device.  I enabled streaming stock quotes on the blackberry and browsed using my iPhone for the entire time to really put it through its paces.  Real world is after heavy usage about 5 hours of battery life.  This will of course change based on coverage areas and the such.Speed?  This is where the MiFi shines - I must say I was impressed.  Since there is no easy way to do a speed test from a mobile device, I simply connected my laptop to it via wi-fi and did 4-5 speed tests in different locations to make them as accurate as possible.  The average speed is about 1.75mbits down and close to 800kbps up.  Impressive to say the least...especially in remote parts of New Jersey and while moving in a vehicle.  (Someone else was driving :-))I am no stranger to mobile connectivity.  The MiFi is a truly amazing device and its size alone makes it a MUST BUY!  The ability to have wi-fi on all mobile devices via EVDO and not having to worry about connecting cards and cables is truly AMAZING.Why then does it get a 4/5 - Simple - No unlimited data plans mean we have to keep our eyes on our usage and we may go over if we are not careful...especially because its so easy to get connected.</text>

        <text>I bought this MiFi thinking that I would swap it for my Aircard that I've been using on Verizon for several years. I was attracted by the ability to have up to 5 devices share one connection.Overall the device will allow up to 5 devices to share the connection. And the speeds have been decent - averaging about 1.5 mb.The problem i that this device constantly disconnects from the Internet and you are forced to wait for it to re-connect. It's not something everyone would notice (you can watch it by going to the control panel at the IP address 192.168.1.1).There are also some really odd problems such as not being able to update the firmware from a Mac, not being able to initially turn on the device and have it work on AC power (I've always had to start it up unplugged and after it's connected attach it to the power cord).I think this is just a really cheap product that I would avoid. It's probably near end-of-life and there are much better (and faster) alternatives coming (see Sprint 4G Novatell).Before you buy - do a quick web search for issues around this model. I found many that I wish I'd known about BEFORE I made the purchase.</text>

        <text>I was really surprised at the amount of tools that comes with this kit. For $10, this has everything that you need to replace a cracked screen. Make sure you read the instructions or watch a YouTube video before attempting to fix it yourself. The glass works really well and the digitizer that comes with it works just like the OEM.I was able to replace the screen in a cafe in a little over 1 hour (it took a while to separate the old glass). The quality is amazing. This kit also comes with a guitar pick. You're probably wondering, why would I need that? However, you'll see later that it becomes really useful when you're trying to separate the glass/digitizer from the metal frame.This comes with a screwdriver, separating tool, guitar pick, some other little tools that I didn't need to use, the glass and digitizer.

        <text>I bought this to replace my wife's broken screen. I've got decent manual dexterity, but I found that this install was very difficult. I finally finished the install, but had to replace it again after the screen broke another time. This time I broke down and just bought the preinstalled screen on the frame with the ear speaker and button (Pre-installed Kit : Apple iPhone 3G Lcd Glass Screen Cover + Touch Screen Digitizer + Frame + Home Flex Button + Ear Speaker + Tool + Foam Pad on Flex). The earpiece wasn't really of Apple quality, but the install was so much easier.So, keep in mind that this is a tough install, and that for not too much more you can get a preinstalled screen on the frame with the home button and ear speaker already installed (making it an easy install). Since these parts have come down so much in price, it may just be worth the gamble to see how you fair with the preinstalled part and save yourself the headache of separating the glass from the frame, installing buttons and speakers, etc. Or, if you are confident in the repair or have done it before, just buy this part and save yourself a few bucks.Anyway, hope this was helpful. Best of wishes with the repair!</text>

        <text>I dropped my 3G iPhone on a Thursday and ordered a replacement screen, with overnight shipping, from a different company. They sent me a 3GS screen which I realized (after the 5th attempt) wasn't going to work. Honestly, I was a bit hesitant to order yet another replacement screen but my checkbook said buying a newer iPhone just wasn't an option. (Amazon kindly refunded my money, btw.)On Sunday I placed my order for this screen replacement. Although Amazon said shipment may take 3-7 days, I just didn't want to shell out for overnight shipping again. Imagine my surprise when it arrived in 2 days.Better yet: following video guides on YouTube and reading written instructions elsewhere, I was able to replace my broken screen in less than 30 minutes. It's touch sensitivity is as good as ever, and I've had absolutely NO problems.A couple of tips that might come in handy:(1) Lay out a dark-colored cloth on your work table before disassembling the iPhone. This will help you see both any slivers of glass that fall out of your cracked screen, but also the incredibly tiny screws you'll be removing and replacing.(2) When re-inserting those teeny tiny screws, I found it helpful to lay my iPhone on its back, pick up the screw with the tip of the screwdriver, then come at the hole from the side. This reduced any chance I'd wiggle the phone while holding it with one hand and trying to insert the screw with the other.(3) YOU WILL NEED YOUR OWN SCREWDRIVERS!(4) If you manage to get fingerprints on your LCD screen use a dry eyeglass cleaning cloth (microfiber type) and gently -- GENTLY -- buff them off.And, above all, go slowly and be patient.</text>

        <text>I researched how to replace the glass in my iPhone, found several videos and watched them.  After this I decided for under $10.00 I could take the chance.  In 1.5 hours I had my iPhone working.  The next one will take less than 1 hour.  Hints to those doing this for the first time, a heat gun works great at loosening up the glue, I think better than a hair dryer would.  My screen poped out easier than what the video's showed so go slow.  Putting the cables back on is the hardest part, go slow, put the ear-speaker cable on first, then the LCD and finally the digitizer.  Try the phone before completely assembling the phone, remember the Home button won't work until fully assembled but everything else will.  Check to make sure the LCD, touchscreen and ear-speaker work, the external speakers will work even if the ear-speaker doesn't so don't use that as a test.  You can slide your card back in for the test and remove it for final assembly.  Getting all 3 things connected took me about 1 hour of my 1.5 hours.  Getting to the point of putting the phone back together was about 30 minutes and I was taking my time to make sure I didn't bend or break anything.  Glad I didn't pay Apple $200.00 or someone onllne $100.00 to do it and have to wait on shipping.This replacement did come with a tool kit that worked perfectly, even though it was not mentioned in the description.  I ordered one in addition and ended up not needing it.  Not sure if that was a fluke or if all replacement screens come with a tool kit. Fair warning make sure you order replacements for 3G or 3Gs, there is a difference.  If you do not know how to tell the difference, Google it and there are plenty of sites to tell you how.Update, after 2 days of using the iPhone I noticed a dead area of the screen.  Contacted New Harbor and they shipped a replacement it within 24 hours of sending the first message.  This one came in and worked.  Very satisfied with thier customer service response.</text>

        <text>My wife's iphone was cracked. We're about to upgrade to the iPhone 4 and I wanted to fix the screen so I can make more selling our old phones.A word of advice before ordering - watch the different items and sellers closely. I used this link to this product (the one you're viewing now) a little over a week ago and paid about $10 from a seller called Digital Media Source. Today the same link lists it at $16.34 from the seller Shivser. If you can be patient with ordering you might be able to get it for less.Definitely watch several YouTube videos on how to do this because my screen came with absolutely no directions. This is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. After reassembling everything the phone is working great and I can't tell a difference between the original screen an the new one. Here are a few things I learned in replacing my screen:1. Don't forget to turn off the phone! I was so eager to get started I forgot to do that, and throughout the process the back portion of the phone (with the battery, speakers, etc) kept chiming with text messages! Fortunately it didn't affect anything.2. Using the suction cup to remove the old screen eliminates the potential damage you might do to the plastic screen frame if you pry it off with the little plastic tool. Just be careful not to pull too hard because you can rip the three connector ribbons off (as happened in one of the YouTube videos!).3. Have a separate dish or cup to put the screws in because they are FREAKIN' TINY! If possible, do everything on a large sheet of white paper (like butcher paper) or on a lightly colored floor because if you drop one it takes forever to find.4. Removing the LCD is tricky, but maybe I was just playing it too safe.5. I used the guitar pick thing to remove the old glass from the plastic frame. I used a hairdryer for about 3 or 4 minutes to partially melt the old glue, then laid the hair dryer down (while still on) and held the glass in front of it while prying it loose with the guitar pick.6. I used tweezers to remove as much of the old adhesive as possible (while the hair dryer was still going).7. If I ever do this again, I might actually use super glue instead of the adhesive sticker things. They were very difficult to position correctly.8. Reconnecting the #1 ribbon was a pain in the butt. Surprisingly this was the most tricky part of the installation to me.9. The home button won't work until you snap the glass back down completely. I was trying to test the phone before I snapped it together and was freaking out because the home button didn't work. Once I snapped it down everything worked fine.The entire process probably took 90 minutes, but I think if I had to do it again - which I probably will with a friend's shattered screen - I could do it in half that time. Also, if you have a suction cup at home I wouldn't waste money on the tool kit. You can buy the small screwdrivers for a buck at the Dollar Tree and any small blade or piece of plastic would work to do the prying.</text>

        <text>I think this phone is Verizon's best phone thus far.  It is a great phone, and is a nice combination upgrade of the top three phones from Verizon (LG Dare, LG enV3, LG Voyager).  The Blackberry Curve is VZW's top device, but I put that more as a PDA phone, rather than a regular phone with extra features (which is what the LG phones I listed above).  I've had many phones from Verizon for about 10 years now;  I have three lines in my account, and I upgrade my phone every year and the two other lines every other year.  IMHO this is the best phone to come out of Verizon.  The keyboard options are nice, though I find myself using the virtual keyboard more (I am used to the LG Dare).  I like the animated scroll (though not as nice as the HTC Touch Diamond or Pro, but again, these two are more data device/PDA phones, rather than regular phones).The screens for the LG enV Touch are quite nice, and definitely look a lot nicer than the LG Dare (and I like my Dare).  On paper, the LG enV Touch screens are better.  Both the internal and external displays of the LG enV Touch have 480x800 pixels, and 16 Million color levels (-vs- 240x400 pixels and 260K color levels on the Dare).  So it makes sense that the Touch screens look better.  (The Samsung Omnia screen is also 240x400 pixels and 65K color levels, so also inferior to the enV Touch).  If you have a chance, take a look at them side-by-side at your local store... you will see what I mean, and the difference will be quite obvious.The camera is quite impressive (3.2 MP) and the large screen size makes taking pictures a lot easier.  Daytime shots come out decent.  The night shots are not the greatest, but even regular cameras have problems with dark scenes.  I've tried the flash feature, and it helps a tiny bit (but I would never use it again. LOL!)I tested the data speed (via dslreports) and the reported speed was 812 kbit/sec, which is slower than my LG Dare (I got 1185 kbit/sec). I placed the phones on the same spot on my desk when I was running the tests, and ran one test per phone (one after the other) for 5 tests, and these are the average speeds of the 5 tests. I'm not sure why the Touch is slightly slower, given that both are EVDO Rev.A. I will next test the mobile broadband speed of both (results pending).  One huge benefit is that the "unlimited" data usage for this phone is only $15/month instead of the $30/month like the other data phones (blackberry, omnia, htc, etc.)The only negative feature I found was the disappointing battery life. I charge it overnight, take it off the charger at 7am, go to work, and by 2pm it has half the battery. This was consistent over the last 5 days I've had the phone.  If I leave the phone alone for an hour or so, when I get back to it the battery is up to 3/4 charged (I did not charge it).  I've even performed a hard reset (took the battery off while the phone was still on, waited over 30 sec, replaced the battery, turned the unit on, and charged overnight). No change in the battery life. I remember this was an issue with the LG Dare when it first came out a year ago, but the issue with the LG enV Touch is worse. I hope LG comes out with a fix for this (like they did with the Dare, and the battery life became significantly better).Altogether, I have been very happy and impressed with this phone. Having tested this unit thoroughly and extensively, I highly recommend this phone.  I am still running some more tests (bluetooth, mobile broadband &amp; tethering, mobile web browsing, apps like VZ Navigator, etc.), and I will update this review in about a week.Having said all this, the LG enV Touch is a GREAT iPhone alternative, but is far from being an iPhone killer.  For those who are not on ATT and/or those who want to move from ATT, I highly recommend this phone.Pros:-Ext &amp; Int screens are clear and large-Camera takes great pictures (for a phone)-FAST Mobile web...like my LG Dare-EVDO Rev.A so mobile broadband with tethering is FAST-dual keyboard (virtual and real)-decent speakers-clear sound for phoneCons:-battery life not very impressive. This is a pity, I actually gave thisphone 6 stars (out of 5) and docked one star for the battery, thus ending with 5 stars still.</text>

        <text>After 2 other LG phones that were buggy and had issues with dropped calls, I told myself I would NEVER buy LG again. But because I wanted a qwerty touch screen phone, my options were limited, so I thought I'd give LG one last try.I could not be more happy! This phone is amazing, touch screen is very responsive, call quality rivals landline quality, takes great quality photos, brilliant display screen, loud ringers, good sized qwerty keyboard for texting, I could go on and on!There are many ways to customize this phone to your needs, there are a multitude of settings. This is the phone I have been waiting for.I got a Samsung Impression last week, but wasn't entirely happy with the phone, but mostly unhappy with AT&amp;T; service, many places I found myself having no signal, for a 3G phone in a major city, this was unacceptable.So I returned the phone and found myself searching for something similar, the Lg Envy Touch was similar, but better as far as features, I was just afraid to try another LG, but they have restored my faith.There a a few minor things I don't like about the Envy Touch, the vibration mode is not that strong, if you have the phone in a case, and your in a noisy place unable to hear the ringer, you need to rely on vibrate mode, but you can hardly feel it vibrate, my wife has an Envy 2, and the vibration is very strong, if it's on a table in vibrate mode, it will move when it rings several inches from where it was because the vibration is so strong, but the Envy Touch is not even close.Would also prefer a slide open instead of a flip, but not a big deal, just a preference. And lastly when texting, the beginning of a sentence does not start in caps, you must hit the shift key, every phone I had the sentence would start in caps, but again no big deal.The pros of this phone are many, the cons are few, there is no such thing as the perfect phone, but this comes pretty close.The Envy Touch is definitely a keeper and I highly recommend it!Update:12/9/09I've had this phone for 6 months now, and it's starting to randomly shut off, took it back to the Verizon store, they gave me a software update, but this didn't help.Also too, when I get text messages, sometimes when I flip open the phone to read my message the screen is blank, I have to close and open it several times before I see anything.I should not be having these problems after only 6 months :(Update: 1/4/10I am now on my 3rd Envy Touch, Verizon gave me a like new replacement, but it had the same problems as the first one, keeps shutting off by itself.So now I'm on my 3rd like new replacement, lets see what happens with this one : (I have once again lost my faith in LG phones, seems they are not built to last.Update : 4/16/10My 3rd Envy Touch died! Never again will I buy LG phones! Totally unreliable!</text>

        <text>The LG ENV touch was my first entry to touch-based screens (I'm still waiting for the iPhone for Verizon - let's hope for early 2011) and I have had it for a year because if I have given a review when I first got it, I would probably have written and raved about it.  But here is my feelings about the phone afterward.After I purchased the LG ENV Touch, it seemed in July 2009, it seemed that right after, there were a good number of better phones that came out right after.  Droid-based phones, new touch devices and granted, this is common and the fact that this phone did not need a data plan which was convenient.But if you are planning to get the LG ENV Touch, there are three things I do recommend. And if anything, you can learn from my mistakes as I tend to drop my cell phones and well, not take the best care of them, like I should.1.  Buy a screen protector - Had this in my suit jacket along with my keys and sure enough, big nice scratch on the screen (sigh).2.  Buy a case protector.  No, not the thin ones for aesthetics.  I'm talking like those Body Glove protectors that are thick because I've dropped this phone many times.  You could try your best and not try to drop it but things happen and in my case, it has created this warping around edge of the top right (obviously some screen damage).3.  Buy a micro SD card.  No you don't have to buy an expensive version, don't be fooled by "cell phone only" as Micro SD card is the same no matter what. With that being said, I've read people not having any success but using Sandisk cards which I do use and I purchased it cheap like $2.99.  Do not spend over $15 for one.  Shop around.POSITIVES:- Great for texting and also for those who use it as an MP3 device to listen to music or podcasts.  Great for those who need to store a database as you can read your excel spreadsheets, documents and PDF's.- Great keyboard, easy to use.- Not that hard to use bitpim on but much easier to load your ringtones on your Micro SD card.- Ease of use.  First time, it might take an hour but after that, you'll get the hang of it.- Connection to your computer via USB to transfer files (to the Micro SD card) is easy.- Quick charge via USB.- Love the speaker phone.- Easy to use apps.- Views .wmv videos quite fine.NEGATIVES:- Battery life - Like most cell phones, you may need an extended battery depending on your use.- This is where I recommend the case because I've dropped this and now the sensitive touch screen will not work that well, I have to flip it on to get it to work. To make things worse, I need to keep the lock on because it starts acting like it's possessed and starts acting on its own as if someone is trying to do several inputs.  Weird.- Photos are not as clear as my wife's Samsung touch phone- Views .wmv videos but very few formats and they have to be several minutes not long.  Tried to put a movie and video wouldn't work, just audio.Overall, The ENV Touch is a very good phone for the basic use having a cell phone and of course, bells and whistles to accompany it. It's not a smart phone, so no data service is required.Since mine is the first generation, one can wonder what LG will have next for the next generation of it.  But learn my situation and get the screen protector and a thicker holder/protector and also a Micro SD card (since they are cheap these days).</text>

        <text>This review will likely be updated as I continue to test this phone.After about 3 years of using Samsung A930 and Verizon's $[...] payment to continue with their plan, and another $[...] rebate from LG, I have switched to LG-VX11000 at a final price of $[...].Why?Because the battery life with the Samsung phone was reduced to less than a day, and even after buying a new battery, it seemed to discharge very quickly. Secondly, writing the obligatory LOLs or OMGs without a QWERTY keyboard was really getting annoying, but this is strictly a secondary reason.I looked at other Samsung phones, but the one I liked--the one with the eInk keyboard--did not have microUSB charger...it had its own charger. One lesson learned from the past is that chargers must be standardized, and microISB seems like a fair attempt at that. This LG phone use this standard, so it's easy and cheap to get a charger from a local general store. Coolness of eInk cannot surpass that.Many other reviews have mentioned many cool things about this phone, but one perspective I'd like to bring to table that maybe new is this: When the phone is unfolded partially it seems to create a sound barrier to keep ambient noise out of the conversation.UPDATE: (Sep. 26, 2010)It's been a year now and I must say I continue to love this phone. I did come across a bit of an annoyance and found a fix relatively quickly. However I didn't see the fix in the Internet, so I decided to add this little note: It is possible that when you insert your MicroSD card, the phone does not recognize the memory card, and may say "CARD NOT INSERTED". At this point, simply take out the battery to let the phone reset itself such that it will recognize the card once you put the battery back in. I hope this is helpful for others.</text>

        <text>Sure, you can't go and download an app for everything. But I'm paying a lot less for my plan and I'm on the Verizon network. That in itself makes up for any lackluster comparisons between the LG EnV Touch &amp; iPhones.The phone is rather large, but I have a big honkin' touch screen - so in my opinion, there is a valid reason for it's size. Plus it makes the QWERTY keyboard that much easier to use so you aren't fat-fingering your emails, texts, etc.I only have 2 complaints that I can even think of off the top of my head (after 3 months of owning it now), which is:1. Apparently there is a software glitch and my phone has been restoring the default wallpapers &amp; shortcuts randomly. I plan to go to Verizon to fix this today as I've read on their forums there is fix.2. Battery life is bad if you use it extensively. I'm looking into an extended life battery.With that, unless your looking for this phone to either be an iPhone or do cartwheels, I can't see why anyone wouldn't like this phone. All my previous concerns or issues were easily resolved by looking up how to fix them (such as calibrating the touch screen) on the Verizon site.</text>

        <text>This phone is simply brilliant. I agree with everything the other reviewer said - mainly that text message sentences don't start in caps. But by no means a big deal! This phone is so easy to use - with the touchscreen or the keyboard. I was worried about the touchscreen and didn't want a touchscreen only phone because of the stories I had heard. This phone has the best of both - full keyboard and touchscreen, but I can tell you the touchscreen works flawlessly. I am really impressed at how easy it is to use. Web browsing is easy too, no need to buy an expensive data plan to surf the web. I use mine for work and play. I was a diehard motorola man, but LG has won me over. When I go shopping for appliances or a TV I will look closer at LG, they just seemed to get all the little details - well most of, the details right. You can't say that about motorola, there phones were starting to slip.This one is a keeper, my only worry is how are they going to make the next one better? This one is that good.p.s. - When shopping for a phone make sure if your a polarized sunglasses wearer like me that you can read that screen! This phone is TOTALLY readable wearing sunglasses. I traded in a samsung alias 2 for this LG - samsung was nice, but in landscape mode the screen was black, portrait it worked fine. Just something you probably wouldn't think of checking for in the store! And again this LG is great with polarized lenses.</text>

        <text>I love my iPhone and use it constantly. The one downside has been the limited battery life when I'm using it for calls or running applications.I was using a Duracell DR7000LI to help extend the time before I'd have to plug back in, but the attached cable and battery made it clumsy to move about and kept getting tangled (yes.. that wasn't the intended purpose, but it worked).When I found out about the Mophie Juice Pack case, I had to try it.The package is impressive... It's attractive and I didn't have to resort to heavy machinary to open it. The unit came fully charged and since I'm not one to read instructions I had my iPhone nestled away in the Mophie in a matter of seconds.I'm impressed with the ease of installation. The phone just slips in and it's a few seconds to attach the top of the case. The workmanship seems good and the iPhone fits into the case snugly. Since the case contains a battery, it's a bit heavier than the phone and somewhat longer and thicker too. I was a little apprehensive at first, but it still fits into my jeans pocket and is much easier to pull out than my older rubber case.I noticed pretty quickly that my battery wasn't draining as quickly as it used to. In the past, I'd have to plug in somewhere or use my external battery pack within an hour and so far, the Mophie has let me continue working without interruption or cables to juggle.The phone's buttons are protected from accidental pressing (much better than my rubber case) and there's a small switch on the bottom of the unit that allows you to turn the external battery off when you don't want to use it. There's also a set of 4 battery check lights that are activated with a small button. A nice touch.Charging the unit's pretty simple, you attach the included micro USB cable to the case and it charges the phone and case battery while the phone syncs with your computer. I was a bit disappointed to find that the dock connector's hidden away from view, but I'm still able to charge the phone and sync so there's not a loss of functionality. One side effect of dock connector being unavailable is that you will have to pull the phone from the case if you want to put your phone in a speaker dock. I also have to remove the phone from the case while I'm using my Kensington LiquidAux Auxiliary car kit. If you must separate the iPhone from the Mophie, they can both charge independently from one another.Positives:Extends battery lifeCase is well made and protects phone.Decent priceEasy installation and  removalBattery check lightProtects buttons from accidental pressingNegatives:dock connector is hidden so you can't use speaker or car docking kits without removing the case.Case is somewhat slippery.The case is a bit longer and thicker than the phone.Added weight may make it somewhat harder to hold for a long period of time.I'm pretty happy with the Mophie Juice Pack.

The product does as intended, but the lifespan is quite poor.  Granted, I paid less than $30 for the battery case, but I would expect at least a 6 month lifespan.

        <text>I have to amend my original review (see below) after owning the item now for several months. I bought the Juice Pack Air in October, despite others' complaints about signal strength, sync not working, and fragile build quality, and I hadn't experienced trouble with any of these, so I gave it four stars in my early review.I've now dropped it down after having problems. Before continuing, I should note THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO REVISIONS OF THIS DEVICE OUT THERE; I know because I've now had two different revisions.PROBLEM 1: On my original Juice Pack Air, the micro-USB connector broke after two months. Sad because I was very, very satisfied with the product until that moment. I only found one or two other people around the web that mention this, but two months after purchase, the micro-USB connector on the case disappeared inside it one evening when I went to plug it in, spelling doom for the case. After determining that I couldn't easily open it and fix it myself with a soldering iron or something, I put in an RMA warranty service request via the Mophie website.Service was reasonably good. Never got a human call or response, but I did get a UPS tag. I shipped them the broken case and a copy of my receipt using the tag (so I didn't have to pay for any shipping) and now, two weeks later, a new case has arrived. So thanks for the exchange Mophie, but it is worrying that the connector isn't attached in a more substantial way (the replacement case is the same).PROBLEM 2: Oddly, the replacement case (supposedly exactly the same product) doesn't fit the iPhone 3Gs nicely as my original case did. This one is a full 2mm longer (yes, LONGER) meaning that there's a big empty gap (enough to slide a penny in) between the top of the phone and the top of the case. Yes, the top IS seated all the way. It's also not nearly as tight. I know that people have complained about the tightness of the Juice Pack Air, but I liked it. This one is still nicely made, but it's now a much more "slide on/slide off easily" affair. Now the case feels less as though it will snugly protect the phone.PROBLEM 3: The replacement unit does indeed kill my signal strength (as others have reported) in a way that my first unit didn't. I wonder what they've changed between revisions that causes this?PROBLEM 4: Sync and charge behavior are frustratingly different with the new unit as well. Clearly there are highly different revisions of this piece of equipment out there. On my first Juice Pack Air, sync worked transparently with the Mophie attached (just plug it in and the computer saw it) and charging was easy, since I just left the switch on the bottom in the "on" position all the time and forgot about it. Plugging it into USB, both the Juice Pack AND the iPhone would charge to full at the same time. Unplugging, the Juice Pack would discharge first, then the iPhone. Now, both charging and sync behaviors are different.First, sync no longer works with the juice pack attached (a problem many others have had). Second, charging now works like this:- When I plug the juice pack in (either switch position), the actual iPhone doesn't charge at the same time (before, no matter whether the switch was red or green, both the iPhone AND the Juice Pack would charge in parallel if it was plugged in). Now, when plugged in the iPhone continues to discharge and will eventually go flat, even as the Juice Pack busily charges.- I have to set the switch to green to charge the actual iPhone, but I MUST UNPLUG the Juice Pack from power for charging to occur (if it's plugged in and I switch to green, the iPhone does not charge). And green or red, the moment I plug the Juice Pack back into power, the iPhone stops charging, no matter the switch position. So basically: you can only charge the Juice Pack when plugged into power (not the iPhone). You can only charge the iPhone when not plugged into power (and then, obviously, you can't charge the Juice Pack).Getting a full charge for both from a full flat for both thus requires the following steps with the replacement unit:1. Plug in Juice Pack. Wait for it to charge (meanwhile, iPhone goes dead and stays dead).2. Disconnect power, flip Juice Pack to green. Wait for iPhone to charge (meanwhile, Juice Pack runs down as it charges).3. Reconnect Juice Pack, replace charge just used (of course, when you plugged in, the iPhone stopped charging and is now running down again while the Juice Pack charges).In short, it's literally impossible to actually get both to a full charge at the same time unless I take the pack OFF of the iPhone and charge them separately. The first Juice Pack Air I had (the one that broke and was replaced under warranty) did NOT behave this way.I suspect that they changed the behavior to this because of the complaints I've read about overheating when both batteries were charging at the same time. I didn't experience that problem with my first Juice Pack, though they did get quite warm.IN ANY CASE, my new review is this: I'll continue to use the thing because I bought it and it does provide extra power. But it's a kind of grudging acceptance and frustration now rather than enthusiasm, and I'm tempted to try to get ahold of one of the competing (and now discontinued, no doubt due to similar types of problems) Incase Power Slider units to see if they're any better.Maybe there's just no way to do this right and Apple should consider releasing an "extended battery" version of the iPhone that's twice as thick for $200 more? I'd pay for it if it gave me double the battery life without all of this "power case" nonsense.----------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:So there I was sitting in the Apple Store in Manhattan trying to find a single case that protected the sync port at the bottom of the iPhone. Couldn't find one. But I did find the Mophie Juice Pack Air for less than twice the price of some of the basic black silicone cases being sold at the store."Not bad," I thought, but I wanted to read a review and see whether the thing was any good, particularly since the Apple Store didn't have an open one on display for me to at least inspect the build quality. Some of the reviews complained about loss of signal strength, much lower than advertised battery power, and/or the inability to sync without removing the iPhone from the Mophie.I contemplated, then I bought, knowing that I could always return it if I hated it. Immediately upon buying, I went straight over to the nearest horizontal surface, opened it, and installed it. Then, I plugged it into the USB port on my laptop.(1) No signal strength degradation (knock on wood).(2) Computer found the iPhone and all was happy with syncing (knock on wood).(3) Later experience has shown that it gives me a good 70% boost in battery length (knock on wood).Apart from that, I think the build quality complaints are really baseless. This is a beautifully finished, very solid, very nicely fitting (incredibly precise tolerances) piece of equipment. Those that are complaining sound like they're removing the case daily. WARNING: It's clearly not designed to be removed and replaced over and over again, you can tell that just by looking at it. If you plan to remove it from your iPhone all the time, this is not the case for you. (And thus, if you plan to use your iPhone with all kinds of docks and docking accessories, this is not the case for you.)This thing is clearly intended for people in good coverage areas who use the iPhone mostly on the go, don't have a ready pile of iPhone accessories that require docking, and need a nice cover and a boost in operation time.The only reasons I give it four stars rather than five: I have no idea how long the battery's lifetime will be; a lot of lesser rechargeable batteries tend to wear out after 20-30 cycles, which I haven't yet gotten to on the Mophie, and also, the micro USB cable that comes with it is TOO DAMNED SHORT (like, a foot and a half, literally) and I had to buy a USB extension cable. Just make the cable longer, guys.</text>

        <text>*** April 23rd Update: Unfortunately the power switch on the unit failed within only 4 weeks of having it (and only light use) - the switch gradually moved deeper inside the unit until one day it separated completely and just rattled around inside the case so I have reduced my review from four to one star. The idea is great but the build quality of the unit is clearly substandard. I have no confidence a replacement will fare any better since this seems to be a design flaw - in trying to get my money back Mophie claim it is TechNGnet's problem to solve (the original seller), TechNGnet claim it is Mophie's problem. I am afraid my advice now is DO NOT buy this case from Mophie unless you are willing to flush seventy bucks down the drain.*** Original Review: I was a little hesitant to buy this battery case based on the feedback, but I knew I still needed something to help my 3GS through a busy day. I had disabled Push and only used 3G sparingly in order to nurse my phone through a whole day and still ended up with low battery warnings at 4pm on some days.I already have a seperate battery but it is clumsy to carry that (plus cable) through the day and charging it each night required more organization than I was capable of. After researching all the alternatives I decided the Mophie Air was the best of the bunch available today, even though I had concerns about the possible drawbacks.I received my Mophie 2 weeks ago and I am very happy with it so far. I knew about the issues ahead of time so my expectations were set accordingly.What works:The form factor is great - it makes the iPhone chunky but guess what - it actually feels better this way and is easier to hold when in use! Materials seem ok, the case doesn't feel cheap and doesn't have garish brand names emblazoned on it, just a nice low key "mophie" imprinted logo. Charge LEDs do the job. Case is snug but fits my 3GS OK and covers the whole phone back and top. Not sure how much protection it really provides but it has to be better than nothing.Battery Capacity:Not amazing but will recharge a dead phone to about 90% which is more than enough for a long day (or two short ones).Convenience:Perfect - always ready when you need it. Charging is simple, plug it in at night with one cable and by morning you have a fully charged phone and case ready for the day. To enable charging when you are low on juice just flick a small recessed switch and your phone is charging back to life, easy. Syncing works fine through the MicroUSB cable.Drawbacks:Cable - yes it's a microUSB which means your docks won't work unless you slide the case off each time - I wasn't really too bothered about this. Extra cables can be found online pretty cheaply.Mute Switch - you can't unmute with the case on, you need to slide the top off to get to the switch. Irritating but not a dealbreaker.Reception - I haven't noticed the big drop in signal strength others have reported - might be a slight reduction but nothing that has given me any trouble (yet?)MicroUSB connector - people have complained that the connector breaks inside the phone after continued use - I haven't had any problems yet but I'm keeping an eye open for this.Price - it's pricy but if your iPhone is a primary tool for you then you'll appreciate the convenience and the investment will be worth it.Best illustrations of how it has saved me already -1) Business call that went much longer than planned, battery was down to 7% - flicked the charger switch mid-call and I was good to go for the rest of the call (and day).2) Writing this review in Starbucks - 20% battery warning just came up but I don't care - it's just time to get the Mophie going.Overall this has completely solved my battery anxiety and made my iPhone a dependable device all day - highly recommended.I just confirmed that Blackberry Micro USB data cables work fine with the Mophie (they charge and sync) and can be purchased very cheaply from Amazon.</text>

        <text>This battery / case about doubles the thickness of your iPhone 3G. It adds a little weight, not really a significant amount. Battery time is just about doubled. I have the black model.The good - this is an excellent case for the back and sides of your iPhone. It does not protect the screen (use this protectorinvisibleSHIELD for the Apple iPhone 3G (Front)). The new charge time is impressive, actually a usable phone now. Whatever time you've gotten with your iPhone, this will just about double that time. For me personally, I used to get right around 24 hours until the red light (&amp;lt;20% charge) came on. Now I can go 2 days before the red light. The plastic is very nice, glossy and looks just about like the iPhone body.The bad - dump your iPhone connector, you will now use one of those micro-USB connectors to charge and connect your iPhone to your computer. No this is not the small USB connector used by digital cameras (you probably have about 50 of these standard cables laying around), this is that new flat connector that is very easy to flip upside down and have no idea you are ruining the connector. It's actually a pain in the rear to use. In addition the connector is recessed pretty deeply into the Mophie case, so some micro-USB connectors won't work. You can sync the phone with this connector.The mediocre, or of no real consequence. The microphone and speaker are covered up by the bottom of the Mophie. There are slots that redirect the sound (down toward the microphone and out toward you for the speaker). The slots don't change the sound at all. This is a two piece device, the battery is in the bottom 3/4 with a plastic cap on the top 1/4. All the controls are now recessed - so it's not super easy to reach the mute switch. All others are easy to get at.This is much much better and thinner than the incase version (Incase Power Slider for iPhone 3G - Black (EC20003)). It looks much better than the other Mophies.There are 4 blue LED's on the back that show how much charge is in the battery. There's also a switch to turn off the battery.Overall, a good case and a very good battery extender. Given that my iPhone now has a useable charge, I don't mind the extra thickness and weight.August 3, 2009 Update - Thank you to Esanta for their comment that I originally called the connector a mini-USB. The connector the Mophie uses is in fact a micro-USB connector (I have corrected the review). Still a pain in the rear, and a lot less common than the mini-USB connector.February 25, 2013 Update: This case is sitting right beside me along with the iPhone 3G that has a slightly cracked screen and is no longer in use. That mophie battery still works. I see this thing is now $20, that is a steal. If you have a 3G or 3GS, this battery is really worth the price of admission.</text>

I am out of battery life in 4 hours if I don't use a supplementary battery.WHAT I HAVE TRIED3GJUICE Major MojoIncase Power SliderPROSPreferentially charges the iPhone before using the iPhone's internal batteryLED indicator for battery lifeSolid constructionCONSShort proprietary Micro-USB CableUnable to use iPhone in docking station with the case installedDecreases signal strength when you have fewer than 5 barsHard to remove iPhone from the unitAdds thickness and weight to the iPhoneDESIGNThis two piece battery/case is constructed of hard plastic with recesses allowing for protection of the buttons along the side and top of the iPhone.  The microphone and speaker are completely covered but do not impede the transmission of sound.  The back has a 4 level LED battery indicator.  The bottom of the unit has a switch allowing the user to toggle the battery on and off.  The fit and finish are excellent, and this has a glossy appearance.  It does not extend far beyond the touch screen but will probably protect the screen against blunt drops.  Unfortunately, if you have an iPhone dock this case will prevent you from using it with the case installed.Removing the iPhone from the Juice Pack Air can be challenging.  First recommendation is to put it on correctly.  Make sure you are sliding the iPhone along the case without much resistance.  If there is the least bit of resistance, imagine how hard it will be to remove it.  Assuming you have installed the case correctly, the best way to take the phone out is by wedging your fingers along the gaps at the bottom of the case, adjacent to the "Mophie" imprint, and pushing down to get a decent gap between the phone and case.  Then, carefully slide the phone up and out of the case.The micro-USB cable takes the place of the iPhone connection but still allows you to plug it into the outlet and USB port.  This also allows for syncing with iTunes without problems, as opposed to the finicky nature of the Incase Power Slider.  The cable is shorter than the OEM USB cable supplied with the iPhone.  Given the proprietary cable, it would serve as a challenge to find a suitable car charger (my vehicle has a built in AC outlet).The phone gets warm when the battery is charging, but not hot to the point that you are uncomfortable.  When driving, I frequently use my Bluetooth interface through my vehicle's speakers.OPERATIONThe battery is already charged and ready for use.  Access to the volume and power buttons is not at all obstructed.  The toggle switch is a little difficult to switch for its size.  Charging time is about 3 hours.  The Juice pack battery is preferentially used over the internal iPhone battery.  When the Juice Pack is down to zero charge, the iPhone will give a message that the device does not support charging for the unit.WIFI signal and 3G signal is not noticeably impeded in areas of strong signal.  However, there is more of a limitation with the Edge Signal in my experience (taking about 1 bar off my indicator).  In areas where signal is poor (without the case on), I get "No Service".  I actually get signal as opposed to the Incase Power Slider which gave me trace signal or "No Service" even in the strongest of 3G networks.Battery life is true to the manufacturer's word, doubling my usable time without a need for a charger.  This allows for about 20 hours of watching a movie or 60 hours of audio (without a plug) - assuming you turn off WIFI, Bluetooth and switch to Airplane Mode.HOW I USE IT IN LOW/LIMITED SIGNAL AREASIf I need to check email or have to send a text to use the network, I will just take the iPhone out of its case momentarily.  After I am done, I put the iPhone back in the Juice Pack Air.  When I alternate with my 3GJUICE Major Mojo or want to charge the phone in the car, I place my iPhone in the Incase Slider.SUMMARYIf you have strong signal in your area, this is a formidable solution to your battery concerns of the iPhone.  In areas of weak signal, you will just have to try it for yourself.  It is an excellent product, but it may not work for everyone depending upon the coverage in your region.</text>

It is interesting that it took about 4 hours to give a full charge so that is something you may consider if buying. But, its great. I still use it even after 2 years! Very durable.</text>

        <text>I bought this originally for the outrageous price of $90, but thought it would be worth it if it got me through a full day of heavy use on my iPhone. The first case worked for about 3 weeks and then stopped working (the case would hold a charge, but not transfer any charge to my iPhone). I returned it (in the same box as my roomates, whose mophie also stopped working at the same time) and received a new one, no questions asked, which is nice. But the new one barely works at all. It extends the life of my iPhone battery for an hour or two but doesn't charge the phone, and it doesn't seem to work if my phone battery drops too low. For example, if my phone is at 20%, I attach the case and where I would normally only have maybe 30 min of talk time, the mophie gets me 60 minutes, but then the phone dies, even though the mophie power meter says it has juice left. This has been a very disappointing product.</text>

        <text>Good style is essential to any Apple design. I have never understood why third party vendors have offered cases for the iPhone 3G and 3GS which look like they were designed by an ad hoc committee at the Lenin tankworks in Minsk.Here we have an exception. The Mophie case is simple, elegant and completely complementary to Apple's styling. But likeWrigley's 5 Stick Doublemint Gum 40 Packs, "it's two, two..." -two devices in one. It has a powerful external battery that extends the notoriously battery like of the original 3G several times.My original plan was to use this hard case when I needed extra battery life. It does present some difficulty in that the Apple pin is covered and the USB connector cannot replicate all Apple connection features. But then again, so what? The essence of an iPhone is still there. I am using it full time.</text>
